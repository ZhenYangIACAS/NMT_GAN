<seg id=642>" the increase in funding will greatly improve the situation , but ... it may take decades to see a gradual improvement , " an expert of the china forestry research institute said .</seg>
<seg id=643>chinese environmentalists raised alarm bells after a survey earlier this year , which found almost a third of the country 's land mass is now desert largely due to human economic activity , such as livestock overgrazing .</seg>
<seg id=644>in the first six months of 2001 , beijing was hit by 18 sandstorms originating from inner mongolia , where 60 percent of the land is desert , the survey said .</seg>
<seg id=645>national people 's congress lawmakers from shanghai , beijing and inner mongolia , who met in beijing this month , have urged the government to set up a " green wall " of trees to block the dust storms .</seg>
<seg id=646>the vice president of the geographical society of china , xu shiyuan , warned that if the government failed to take action , sandstorms could blow as far as shanghai , the shanghai star newspaper said .</seg>

<seg id=650>according to the reports , most of the forged certificates relate to adult education and self-study examination certificates . approximately two - third are forged in the street and the other one - third are forged by formal educational institutions .</seg>
<seg id=651>at the time the center was first established , many institutions are in the process of reform . hence , units of organizations or enterprises have submitted the bulk of the certificates for verification . in many cases , the owners of the forged certificates are actually cadres currently on the job , the officer - in - charge of the center said .</seg>

<seg id=718>singapore airlines ' crash in taiwan : aviation safety council has delayed its report ; prosecutor 's office is asking why</seg>
<seg id=719>taipei news -- the singapore airlines crash had happened for more than one and half years . however , taiwan 's aviation safety council ( sac ) has delayed the release of its final report several times , which has effectively made the investigation by taoyuan prosecutor 's office to a standstill . the prosecutor 's office is challenging the rationale and sac has now undertaken to release a report before end of april .</seg>
<seg id=720>on october 31 , 2000 at 11:18 pm , singapore airlines ' sq - 006 attempted to take off from chiang kai shek international airport for los angeles . in the course of the take off , the plane entered 05 - right runway . the plane then hit two dredgers that were on the runway . the impact caused an explosion and the death of 83 passengers . more than 100 passengers were injured in the accident .</seg>
<seg id=721>" china times " reported yesterday : the taoyuan prosecutor 's office has been investigating for possible criminal liabilities in parallel to a probe into the cause of the crash by sac . unfortunately , the two have several disputes over investigation rights .</seg>

<seg id=723>sac originally says that they can complete the investigation by the end of last year . sac subsequently delayed the report to end of january . by january , sac changed the report date to end of february and there is no further news since then . after pressed by the prosecutor 's office , sac has now undertaken to delver a report by the end of april .</seg>
<seg id=724>the destination of sq - 006 was los angeles and some passengers are americans . hence , some family members of passengers who died in the crash have already commenced legal actions in u.s. courts for damages against singapore airlines and also in some cases , against taiwan 's civil aeronautics administration .</seg>
<seg id=725>the claims by family members are equivalent to an accusation of negligence on the part of taiwan 's civil aeronautics administration . hence , the conclusion of the investigation by taoyuan prosecutor 's office becomes important .</seg>

<seg id=804>( hong kong ) the chinese police recently conducted an internal review over the incident that 25 north koreans stormed the spanish embassy last week .</seg>
<seg id=805>it is estimated that in beijing alone , more than 150 north koreans are waiting for their chances to go to south korea . the authorities have stepped up security on major embassies such as those of south korea , japan and western nations in the embassy district so as to prevent " storming " incidents from happening again .</seg>
<seg id=806>singtao reported yesterday that public security sources indicated that since 25 north koreans stormed the spanish embassy by surprise on march 14 , beijing police , in addition to the increased security it has provided to those embassies of sensitive nations , has further stepped up protection for the embassies of non-sensitive nations while maintaining a closer contact with the officials of north korean and south korean embassies in beijing .</seg>
<seg id=807>the sources pointed out , staff from the south korean embassy indicated to the chinese officials that south korea does not encourage north koreans to go to south korea through this means and south korea does not hope to see similar incidents again so that the relations between china and the korean peninsula are not affected . south korea also promises china that it will assist china in managing the south korean residents in beijing .</seg>

<seg id=809>in the past , the authorities did not consider the ethnic koreans as the focus of their supervision because they were not big in number in beijing , nor did they get involved in so many criminal offenses like those people from xinjiang and henan .</seg>
<seg id=810>it is reported that after the march 14 incident , the public security agency first " invited " the german doctor who assisted those 25 north koreans for a " talk " at the public security agency and then escorted him to the airport for immediate departure from china .</seg>
<seg id=811>afterwards , the public security agency and the national security agency started an internal review .</seg>
<seg id=812>the review mainly consists of two parts : the security protection of the embassy district and the management of the ethnic koreans in beijing .</seg>
<seg id=813>in addition , the authorities also required the relevant agencies in regions such as jilin to take effective measures to prevent north koreans who have illegally crossed the border from entering beijing .</seg>

<seg id=876>he said : " the position has n't changed . these are our normal contacts with the taiwanese . we will continue to do so . "</seg>
<seg id=877>zhang qiyue also confirmed yesterday the russian media 's report , saying that the chinese president jiang zemin called the russian president putin by phone at his request the night before , and both sides exchanged their opinions on cooperations between china and russia based on mutual benefits .</seg>
