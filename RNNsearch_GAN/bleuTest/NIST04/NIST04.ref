<seg id=1>as we entered the new century , globalization becomes an important and rigorous challenge facing african countries .</seg>
<seg id=2>the leaders of african countries understand more and more clearly that africa cannot let slip a good opportunity and should rise with spirit to found counter measures .</seg>
<seg id=3>on july 9 , 2002 , the african union was formed and has commenced operations . since then , on one hand , african countries have been actively promoting the " new partnership for african development " . they endeavor to develop their economies and strive to break away from an unfavorable position in globalization . on the other hand , african countries are exerting great efforts to remove any man - made barriers to the grand mission of an africa revival -- the armed conflict problem , such as to create a united , peaceful and stable environment .</seg>
<seg id=4>at present , the overall situation in africa is easing up and hot issues are cooling down . different nations are feeling the sense of urgency to end the armed conflict .</seg>
<seg id=5>with the strong support from united nations and international community , influential regional institutions in africa , big countries in the regions and even famous politicians are all taking active actions to step up efforts to resolve regional conflict and internal turmoil . as a result , some prolonged conflict and instability are basically under control .</seg>
<seg id=6>for example , the democratic republic of congo has formed a national reconciliation government in june last year . the republic of sao tome and principe has resolved its coup crisis peacefully in july last year . the government of liberia has signed a peace accord with the armed rebels in accra , capital of ghana , in august last year . the sudan government has held a crucial meeting with the southern - armed rebels in september last year , which was a breakthrough of the deadlock in the peace process . in october , the different armed and political groups in somali have held peace talks in kenya to discuss a nationwide peace process . in november , burundi government has signed a peace accord with anti-government rebels .</seg>
<seg id=7>naturally , stability in the african region is still relatively fragile and the peace fruit still requires further strengthening . some potential or actual armed conflicts are still awaiting a final resolution .</seg>
<seg id=8>meanwhile , the pace of economic development in african countries is still showing a huge gap with that in developing countries in asia . this is obviously an unfavorable factor for development in africa .</seg>
<seg id=9>it obviously requires long - term and arduous efforts from the people of africa before african countries can effectively deal with the challenges of globalization and realize the dream of an africa revival .</seg>

<seg id=17>the beagle 2 was scheduled to land on mars on christmas day , but its signal is still difficult to pin down .</seg>
<seg id=18>beagle 2 became the first european spacecraft to land on another planet after it was released from mars express on december 19 .</seg>

<seg id=385>democratic party : baghdad blast is evidence of a failure of u.s. policy in iraq</seg>
<seg id=386>( agence france - presse , washington , 18th ) - democratic presidential candidates seeking to replace bush in the white house have all pointed out today that the latest massive suicide bombing in baghdad is evidence of a failure of united states policy in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=387>this attack , killing at least 25 people and injuring about 30 people , is the most deadly attack since the beginning of the u.s. occupation .</seg>
<seg id=388>bush 's democratic opponents criticized bush 's iraq policy severely . some of the opponents said the attack is the latest proof of a failure in bush 's iraq policy .</seg>
<seg id=389>" we have a failed policy right now . i have no idea why the administration is not willing to change it , " edwards , senator of north carolina told cbs television .</seg>
<seg id=390>" obviously , the first thing we need to do is to internationalize the security force in iraq . another thing to do is to hand over the transitional government to the united nations , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=391>in a public appearance with democratic presidential candidate dean , former u.s. president carter said the u.s. - led iraq war " has proven to be based on erroneous information and misleading statements " while the latest attack is " a sustained demonstration of tragedy " .</seg>
<seg id=392>dean has put his election focus on opposing the iraq war .</seg>
<seg id=393>iraqi insurgents use advanced weapons against u.s. helicopters</seg>
<seg id=394>( agence france - presse , washington , 18th ) - senior u.s. army officials said iraqi rebels are using increasingly sophisticated weapons to attack u.s. helicopters .</seg>
<seg id=395>senior army officials familiar with a classified study told new york times today that the study found iraqi guerrillas have used rocket - propelled grenades as well as more advanced heat - seeking surface - to - air missiles to attack u.s. helicopters .</seg>
<seg id=396>the officials said the study was conducted before the three most recent attacks this month , but those incidents can only reinforce the report 's findings .</seg>
<seg id=397>the study aimed at identifying ways to help pilots evade attacks by iraqi guerrillas using this kind of weapons but the officials did not elaborate on any new discovery .</seg>
<seg id=398>judging from the methodology used in the new wave of attack , it is certainly disturbing because it appears the iraqi guerrillas have already studied the fighting tactics of u.s. aircrafts carefully .</seg>
<seg id=399>the research team has found the iraqi insurgents used an sa - 16 shoulder - fired missile in more than one occasion , which is especially worrying .</seg>
<seg id=400>this type of missile has a sophisticated guidance system that is harder for pilots to thwart .</seg>
<seg id=401>a senior army aviator in the persian gulf region said , " the enemy enjoys a strategic success each time one of our aircraft is shot down .</seg>
<seg id=402>it becomes a major media event and the defeat or victory is decided immediately . therefore , the enemy sees this tactics as very useful . "</seg>

<seg id=406>" i have been particularly grateful at the courageous and outspoken posture and position that governor dean has taken from the beginning , " carter told reporters in his hometown , georgia plains .</seg>
<seg id=407>the nobel peace prize laureate said , " in the last year and a half , i have spent a lot of time strongly opposing the completely unnecessary and unjust war in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=408>despite my strong efforts , the war commenced and now has proven to be , not only based on erroneous information and misleading statements , but also a sustained demonstration of tragedy . "</seg>
<seg id=409>carter praised dean as a strong " advocate of peace " . his statements fell short of a formal endorsement , but u.s. televisions broadcasted carter 's remarks .</seg>
<seg id=410>as a left - leaning former governor of a northern state , dean could be at a disadvantageous position when he faces clark , a retired general and a centrist from arkansas . however , carter 's support could boost dean 's chances in the more conservative , religion - conscious southern states .</seg>
<seg id=411>carter said in a recent television interview that he saw dean as the most likely democratic candidate to go against bush .</seg>

<seg id=416>clark , a leading contender for the democratic nomination , said bush had created his own " axis of evil " .</seg>
<seg id=417>two years ago , bush created the term " axis of evil " in his state of the union speech to describe some countries that were threatening united states .</seg>
<seg id=418>" that is an axis of fiscal policies that threaten our future ; foreign policies that threaten our security and domestic policies that put families dead , " clark said .</seg>

<seg id=473>( agence france - presse , paris , 29th ) - snowfall blanketed about half of northern and western europe triggering traffic and rail chaos as well as cancellation of hundreds of flights in britain , germany and denmark .</seg>

<seg id=477>transport authorities said the remaining several dozens of flights for frankfurt experienced delays and that the wintry weather was likely to affect air traffic for the rest of the day .</seg>
<seg id=478>in france , road traffic restrictions went into force in paris after snowfall last night , but similar measures in other parts of the country were lifted early this morning .</seg>
<seg id=479>services at the main paris airports were reported to be near normal . yesterday , charles de gaulle airport reported delays due to a combination of snow and fog .</seg>
<seg id=480>nevertheless , the paris airports authority advised air travelers to check whether their flights were delayed before leaving home .</seg>
<seg id=481>with the exception of the mediterranean coast , most of france was blanketed in snow .</seg>
<seg id=482>taiwan and japan are both democratic countries . both have the obligation and , even more , the responsibility to jointly strive for democracy in asia .</seg>
<seg id=483>in order to propagate the value of democracy , our government will establish the " taiwan foundation for democracy " in the near future and one of its important jobs is to cooperate with other political parties in foreign countries .</seg>
<seg id=484>through this fund , the democratic progressive party wishes to work hand - in - hand with other democratic parties in the world and shares its experience in democratic development with them . we wish to contribute to peace , stability and prosperity in asia . we hope the dream of a " democratic alliance in asia " can be realized at an early date .</seg>
<seg id=485>international situations are varying from minute to minute these days . the rise and fall of one force in the region may affect the whole situation and could put the safety of other countries to test .</seg>
<seg id=486>in the asia pacific region , north korea , embraced with its nuclear power , had test - fired several missiles since u.s. started its war on iraq last month . the missiles flew over the territorial air space of japan . furthermore , china has been actively expanding its military strength for quite some time and deployed missiles directly aimed at taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=487>all these moves have become a serious safety threat to taiwan , japan and the asia pacific region .</seg>
<seg id=488>this is an issue about strengthening of democracy as well as security and protection . therefore , it needs a formal security mechanism before it can be fully discussed and resolved .</seg>
<seg id=489>in today 's meeting , the democratic progressive party , as the ruling party in taiwan , is holding an official dialogue with japan 's ruling party , the liberal democratic party , and other legislators from other parties for the first time on the issue of security . its importance goes without saying that .</seg>
<seg id=490>apart from bilateral dialogue between taiwan and japan , i personally hope that u.s. , japan , south korea and other pacific rim countries can cooperate to promote the establishment of a " safety and security dialogue mechanism " in the future and support taiwan 's participation in multi-lateral dialogue organizations in the region in order to implement the spirit of " cooperative security " .</seg>
<seg id=491>today is an important moment inspiring our further advancement in the route of reforms . we have to give our greatest appreciation to all comrades in our party for their support to the party 's willpower and made joint efforts to achieve our reform objective .</seg>
<seg id=492>" political party 's withdrawal from mass media " is the most fundamental requirement for the implementation of a media reform . the democratic progressive party has always insisted on the concept that ruling can only accelerate the speed of reform but not an obstruction or burden .</seg>
<seg id=493>to promote this reform objective , we also know that all comrades in our party with a pubic position have to take lead and withdraw from media operations . however , that is only a tiny step in the media reform but it is also a critical step .</seg>
<seg id=494>during the martial law era , the mass media was monopolized and many comrades in the party have fought to open up public opinion in media . they have committed themselves to difficult tasks of organizing the fourth station and other local radio stations etc. they hoped to use these methods to break through the restrictions at that time and provide more momentum for redevelopment of the media environment .</seg>
<seg id=495>for example , in order to foster the creation of the fourth television station at that time , comrade trong chai has put forth a large amount of painstaking efforts and finally the " formosa television " was born .</seg>
<seg id=496>his move has a significant impact to the media environment , especially the break - up of the long - time monopoly of the three stations , and created more space for the expansion of the cable television industry .</seg>
<seg id=497>in our process of promoting reforms , we must understand that there are many things we have no choice but to do because of restrictions in history and environment . as the mass media is completely free and opened today , it signifies that our mission in this phase is completed . to enable the reform process to continue moving forward , it is necessary for us to make selection and sacrifice .</seg>
<seg id=498>the central standing committee has announced that all comrades with a public position must withdraw from media operation before the next legislative session , that is september 5th , in order to set a good example and fulfill the party 's undertaking to the people .</seg>
<seg id=499>we are gratified that everyone has taken full consideration of the party 's ideal and objective . comrades who have made many contributions in the democratic movements , including trong chai , chang chun - hung , chou ching - yu , hou shui - sheng , kao meng - ting , hwang nae - hui and sung min - kong etc. , have sacrificed their self interest and attach most importance to the promotion of media reform .</seg>
<seg id=500>to govern is not to enjoy power , but rather to embrace responsibility .</seg>
<seg id=501>the democratic progressive party might have encountered obstacles and setbacks in its governing process . but , we have always been able to turn challenges into momentum for moving forward , leading taiwan firmly and safely in its efforts for advancing into total democracy and connecting itself with the universal values of democracy , peace , and prosperity .</seg>
<seg id=502>because we have always believed that people are the masters of our country . the democratic progressive party 's responsibility is to elevate its founding spirit of " clean government , conscientious rule , and love for the homeland " to a bright vision of " reforms , progress , and a good life , " laying a foundation of long term peace and stability for the 23 million taiwanese .</seg>
<seg id=503>for a long time , the democratic progressive party acted as the " government 's delegate " in efforts to expand taiwan 's diplomacy and has attained admirable results .</seg>
<seg id=504>despite communist china 's continual suppression , we have not retreated because destiny is in our hands . notwithstanding our lack of bountiful resources , the democratic progressive party has , step - by - step , helped taiwan expand its international participation and visibility .</seg>
<seg id=505>" multilateral diplomacy " is the main axis of the democratic progressive party 's diplomatic strategy . in the past year , we have successfully used the " council on asian liberals and democrats " as a platform to exchange views with other countries and political parties in the region . we shared our experiences with them on a range of issues , including economic challenges in east asia , democratic reforms within a political party , the removal of money politics , resolutions for problems related to globalization and poverty , political propaganda and communications , and youth participation in politics etc.</seg>
<seg id=506>next march , i will formally assume the chair of the " council on asian liberals and democrats " . i hope to use the position as a leader of an international organization to find more opportunities for taiwan to contribute to the international community .</seg>
<seg id=507>in addition , the democratic progressive party has actively participated in the activities of the " liberal international " since it became a formal member last year .</seg>
<seg id=508>apart from sending a human rights commissioner to be stationed at the secretariat of liberal international 's london headquarters , we will cooperate with other member parties on political reform forums to be held in various locations in central america , south america and europe etc.</seg>
<seg id=509>september 28 marked our party 's seventeenth anniversary .</seg>
<seg id=510>the seventeen - year - old democratic progressive party has always adhered to its democratic ideals , full of energy in reform and progress .</seg>
<seg id=511>we have won the trust of taiwanese people because we always stand on the side of democracy and reform . for the same reason , we are going to bear sterner and more important responsibility and mandate in the future .</seg>
<seg id=512>three years ago , we took over the burden as a governing party . at that time , the previous administration had already circuitously amended the constitution six times in the nineties .</seg>
<seg id=513>the issue of complete re-election of the legislature was addressed in 1991 , provisions for direct presidential elections were instated in 1994 , revisions in 1997 frozen the organization of the provincial government , and the national assembly was turned into a non-standing body in 2000 . this tortuous process of constitution amendment is the path taken by the people of taiwan to strengthen our country 's sovereignty and democratic legitimacy</seg>
<seg id=514>if we take the 1996 direct presidential election as the most important symbol that taiwan has become an independent democratic sovereignty , then this ' complete ' nation will be ten years old by 2006 .</seg>
<seg id=515>after putting democracy into practice for a decade , we must consider , as an independent democratic sovereignty , what will we pursue in our next step ?</seg>
<seg id=516>i must say the next phase should be deepening of our democracy and work towards a more efficient constitutional framework . this can lead the people of taiwan to meet the rigorous challenges in the new century .</seg>
<seg id=517>asia is the largest continent on earth , with nearly 30 percent of the world land area and about 60 percent of the world population at this moment . its economic activities accounted for one quarter of the world 's total . it should and it could make remarkable contribution to world peace and development .</seg>
<seg id=518>asia has a time - honored and glorious culture . the valleys of yellow river , yangtze river , indus river , ganges river , the euphrates and the tigris are all known as cradles of human civilization .</seg>
<seg id=519>in its lengthy progress through history , the people of asia have composed resplendent pages and chapters on human civilization development .</seg>
<seg id=520>in recent generations , asia has experienced many suffering and vicissitudes of life . the people of different nations strived for liberation , sought development and made untiring efforts before asia attained some enormous achievements .</seg>
<seg id=521>but , to realize a new up - rise and revitalization of asia , there is still a long way to go .</seg>
<seg id=522>asia needs better cooperation and should encourage development in order to achieve a win - win situation . this is the only route to a new up - rise and revitalization of asia , which is also in the fundamental interest of all people in asia .</seg>
<seg id=523>given new situations in the new century , asian developments are facing new opportunities .</seg>
<seg id=524>peace and development is still theme of our era . an overall peaceful environment among nations has provided a favorable external condition for asian development .</seg>
<seg id=525>as globalization intensifies and technology revolution advances by leaps and bounds around the world , the optimization or reorganization of essential production factors and the transformation of industries in international markets have accelerated , which is beneficial for asian countries to make better use of international capitals , to import advance technology , to explore new international markets and finally stimulate local economic developments .</seg>
<seg id=526>asia has abundant resources and possesses a vast market . it is also a region with the best economic vitality in our world . its development potential is huge .</seg>
<seg id=527>lots of people , but not developed . these are the two crucial national conditions of china .</seg>
<seg id=528>china has a population of 1.3 billion . no matter how small a problem may be , it becomes a big problem when it is multiplied by 1.3 billion . no matter how sizable finances or resources may appear to be , they become a very low average when divided by 1.3 billion .</seg>
<seg id=529>this is what a chinese leader must keep firmly in mind at all times .</seg>
<seg id=530>to solve the 1.3 - billion - population problem , we cannot depend on others but only on ourselves .</seg>
<seg id=531>since the founding of the people 's republic of china , we have attained significant achievements in our development , but we also took some winding courses and lost some valuable opportunities .</seg>
<seg id=532>since the reform and opening in 1978 , we have finally found a correct path for our own development .</seg>
<seg id=533>and this is : the people of china have to build their own socialism with chinese characteristics independently .</seg>
<seg id=534>the essence of this path is to mobilize all positive factors , liberate and develop production capability , respect and protect the chinese people 's freedom to pursue happiness and well - being .</seg>
<seg id=535>china 's reform and opening have covered rural villages to cities , from economic issues to political , cultural and social areas .</seg>
<seg id=536>as we move step by step deeper into this process , the bottom - line is always to let vitality in labor , know - how , technology , management and capital to burst forth without restraint , enabling all resources for creation of social wealth to flow smoothly .</seg>
<seg id=537>in recent years , the world has undergone profound changes . science and technology advance with each passing day and productivity in our world is rising unceasingly . world markets are knitted together more closely than before creating unprecedented development opportunities for all nations .</seg>
<seg id=538>however , it is worthwhile to note that problems of power politics , regional conflicts , terrorism , contagious diseases and environmental contamination are still threatening the stability and development of our world .</seg>
<seg id=539>the negative impacts of globalization elevate the risk and price of economic and social developments in developing countries . in fact , some developing countries are facing the risk of being marginalized .</seg>
<seg id=540>at present , the world is stilling facing many uncertainties notwithstanding a gradual recovery in the global economy .</seg>
<seg id=541>the setback of multilateral trade negotiations in the doha round and complicated factors like protectionism etc. have increased the difficulties in developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=542>but , it is gratified to note the vast majority of developing nations are enthusiastic for making progress , with keen determination for reform and are willing to contribute great efforts to build a strong state . as a result , they have achieved excellent accomplishments that everyone gazes at .</seg>
<seg id=543>in the international stage , developing countries rely on the non-aligned movement , group of 77 etc. as support and have strengthened their alliance and cooperation . they have made important contributions to protect their own legitimate rights and changed unreasonable international order in politics and economy . their efforts become important forces to democratize international relations .</seg>
<seg id=544>meanwhile , communication and cooperation between developing countries have also achieved fruitful results , elevating economic dealings and contacts among themselves .</seg>
<seg id=545>from the andes to mekong riverside , from the union of arab maghreb to the formation of african union and the south - south cooperation -- no matter it is content to formality , mechanism to measures , everything has been improved , enriched and updated .</seg>
<seg id=546>in the past year , the friendly cooperation between china and canada has continued to develop on all fronts .</seg>
<seg id=547>trading between the two nations continues to grow and total trades amounted to nearly ten billion u.s. dollars .</seg>
<seg id=548>frequent high - level contacts continue . canada 's ministers for foreign affairs , national defense , environment and international cooperation as well as other important politicians have visited china in succession . senior chinese officials , including the chief justice of supreme court and minister of commerce , have also visited canada one after the other . more important , the prime ministers of two nations also visited each other .</seg>
<seg id=549>premier wen jiabao 's recent visit to canada has the significance of honoring the past and striving for a better future . the visit injected new vitality to the further development of sino - canada relation and has laid a solid foundation for a wider and deeper friendly cooperation between the two countries in many areas .</seg>
<seg id=550>china and canada will continue to strengthen the cooperation between the two nations in areas like politics , economy , education , culture and technology etc. , striving for the target of doubling the bilateral trades by 2010 .</seg>
<seg id=551>dear compatriots , dear friends .</seg>
<seg id=552>notwithstanding you are living in an overseas country , your hearts are always tied to the homeland . you have followed with interest the developments in the mother country . in every critical juncture , you are always sharing the worries or joys of the people of your mother country . in fact , your pulses are beating together with the mother country .</seg>
<seg id=553>last year , some areas in china were affected by sars and flooding . you people have expressed your heartfelt concerns and blessing to the people of the mother country in various ways , including the internet , letters , telephone and donations etc. the different circles in the chinese community have organized several large scale fund raising and charitable entertainment events . when the " shenzhou 5 " manned space program achieved great success , numerous congratulatory messages , letters and cards were received from you people . everyone is so proud , elated and inspired by china 's achievements in space technology .</seg>
<seg id=554>during premier wen 's visit in canada , hundreds of compatriots living here together with chinese students studying in canada welcomed the premier at the airport and at the parliament hill , despite the wind , rain and severe cold , creating so many touching and moving moments .</seg>
<seg id=555>here , i wish to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to you . in the new year , i trust all of you will continue to make new contributions for a thriving and prosperous china , for developments of sino - canada relation , for total unification of china and for an all - round revival of china .</seg>
<seg id=556>first , it is important to strengthen our mutual political trust and deepens our strategic alliance .</seg>
<seg id=557>china and france are both permanent members of united nations security council and both have important influence to international affairs .</seg>
<seg id=558>both countries are in favor of multi-polarization in our world . both advocate the preservation of authoritativeness of untied nations . both are willing to promote the establishment of new international order in politics and economies according to wishes of all people over our world .</seg>
<seg id=559>both countries share many common consensuses and common interests in dealing with different challenges facing mankind as well as in the proper handling of important international affairs etc.</seg>
<seg id=560>china is willing to reinforce consultation and dialogue with france on important issues such as anti-terrorism , anti-proliferation , curb on international crime , promotion of mutual development and strengthening of united nations ' role etc. china is willing to cooperate closely with france and strives for protection of world peace and the promotion of common prosperity .</seg>
<seg id=561>second , it is important to strengthen economic cooperation for mutual benefits and to complement each other .</seg>
<seg id=562>china is the largest developing country in the world amid the process of an all - out development and modernization , and hence , it possesses vast market potential .</seg>
<seg id=563>france is a developed country at the forefront of economic , scientific and technological development in our world and possesses advanced technologies in many fields .</seg>
<seg id=564>the economies of our two countries are strongly complementary to each other and there are lots of opportunities for economic and trading cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=565>since the founding of new china , the chinese government has always attached high importance to the development of african relation and adopted a series of guiding principles and policies .</seg>
<seg id=566>all along , we have adhered to the five principles of peaceful coexistence . we respect the independent choices made by african countries for their political systems and development routes . we have provided assistance to african countries within our best capability and started economic and technical cooperation with them . we support cooperation among african countries and their united efforts to improve themselves . we have asked international community to attach more importance to peace and development in africa and , at the same time , we also support african countries ' participation in international affairs with equal standing . we have strengthened our consultation and cooperation with africa and made joint efforts to safeguard the rights and interests of developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=567>china - africa friendship has a very long history and is deeply rooted in the hearts of our people .</seg>
<seg id=568>since the founding of new china , we have always firmly supported the cause of national liberation in africa and extended our sincere support to help develop national economies in african countries .</seg>
<seg id=569>we have dispatched chinese experts , doctors , teachers and workers to work side by side with local people in africa , get along well with them , and are attached to each other like brothers .</seg>
<seg id=570>in international affairs , china and african countries understand each other , support each other and become partners to be counted on .</seg>
<seg id=571>the chinese people will never forget the strong support by the vast number of developing countries , including those in africa , without which china could not successfully regain its lawful seat in the united nations at the 26th session of the united nations general assembly in 1971 .</seg>
<seg id=572>the political trust between china and africa at various levels and among different officials has deepened in recent years . trade and economic cooperation become more fruitful . friendly associations in culture , education , health care , science , technology and sports developed vigorously . the forum on china - africa cooperation launched at the beginning of the century has become a new platform for closer china - africa relation and stronger cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=573>china and africa have set out to establish a new type of partnership for long - term stability , equality and mutual benefits . china - africa friendship and cooperation have entered a new stage of all - round development .</seg>
<seg id=574>seven years after nixon visited china and the sino - u.s. joint communique in shanghai , the carter administration finally accepted china 's stance on the taiwan issue and the two countries successfully established diplomatic relation .</seg>
<seg id=575>this event and deng xiaoping 's successful visit to u.s. started a new chapter in sino - u.s. relation .</seg>
<seg id=576>when reagan first assumed office , china and u.s. had some intense arguments about the taiwan problem .</seg>
<seg id=577>after difficult negotiations , the two governments announced the " august 17 " communique in 1982 and agreed to solve the taiwan weapon sales problem by steps .</seg>
<seg id=578>the shanghai communique , sino - u.s. diplomatic relation communique and the " august 17 " communique have collectively formed the political foundation for sino - u.s. relation .</seg>
<seg id=579>after the establishment of diplomatic relation for 10 years , the overall sino - u.s. relation is stable notwithstanding the two countries still have some struggle over the taiwan issue from time to time . association and cooperation in many areas are increasing day by day .</seg>
<seg id=580>in the eighties and early nineties of the twentieth century , dramatic changes took place in eastern europe . on disintegration of soviet union and ending of the cold war , international situation has taken the greatest change since world war ii .</seg>
<seg id=581>u.s. took the lead to sanction china and announced the sale of 150 f - 16 fighters to taiwan . u.s. linked the human right issue with the most favored nation status and allowed lee teng - hui to visit america . the sino - u.s. relation sank to a low point .</seg>
<seg id=582>as china 's economy started to grow rapidly , china 's international position has risen gradually .</seg>
<seg id=583>more and more americans began to recognize the improvement and development of sino - u.s. relation is in the fundamental interest of united states and china .</seg>
<seg id=584>six months ago , it was also in this hall that we successfully started the six - party talks and established the direction to solve the nuclear problem peacefully .</seg>
<seg id=585>during the past six months , different sides have commenced ongoing dialogue and discussions . in order to hold a new round of talks , a lot of work was done and in - depth preparation has been made . through this process , we have improved the understanding of each other 's stands .</seg>
<seg id=586>now , all sides expect to discuss specific issues in the second round talks and are looking forward to achieve concrete results . we all believe our concerns can be resolved through coordinated and concerted steps . we all hope that the peace process established by the six - party talks can continue .</seg>
<seg id=587>these are the important foundation for our talks today .</seg>
<seg id=588>the important meaning of the second round talks is to start discussion on specific problems and it also symbolizes the peace process has stridden another step forward .</seg>
<seg id=589>this round of talks will touch on how to set up specific targets to solve the nuclear problem , explore first phase measures for solving the nuclear problem and study ways to continue the talks .</seg>
<seg id=590>as the talks deepen , we may have to respond to other difficulties and face more challenges . however , this is our job endowed by history and expectations given to us by international community .</seg>
<seg id=591>the six parties gathering here are representing the strong political desire for peace by the people and government in the six countries .</seg>
<seg id=592>our talks are to enlarge common consensuses . it is not for highlighting discrepancy . it is for solving problems but not for agitating contradictions .</seg>
<seg id=593>china believes all sides have now recognized the peace mission that we are shouldering . we have to adopt a constructive attitude , cooperative and tolerant spirit , respect each other and show flexibility in order to narrow our differences .</seg>
<seg id=594>the second round of six - party talks in beijing has finished the pre-set agenda after three days of discussion .</seg>
<seg id=595>i wish to thank the representatives and heads of delegations , their governments , and all workers for their contribution in this meeting .</seg>
<seg id=596>if we say the first round of talks has established the main objective of denuclearization in the korean peninsula , then the meaning of this round of talks is to proceed with specific dialogue and takes a new step forward to the main objective .</seg>
<seg id=597>in the meeting , all sides have carried out in depth and constructive discussions . all sides have used their wisdom and explored rationally the methods and steps necessary for solving the problem . useful tentative ideas have been brought up by different sides , which positively indicated their own policies .</seg>
<seg id=598>the meeting has achieved a series of useful results . in particular , consensus has been reached for the next round of meeting and the set - up of a work group . hence , the meeting has an important meaning in pushing ahead with the peace process .</seg>
<seg id=599>dear colleague : peace and development are the theme of our mighty era .</seg>
<seg id=600>ladies and gentlemen , you are representing the people of the six nations and their needs , desire and adoration for peace . in fact , people everywhere in the world need peace , desire for peace and adore peace .</seg>
<seg id=601>in the past three days , international community is watching beijing , looking attentively at diaoyutai and has placed high hope on this round of talks .</seg>
<seg id=602>perhaps some people may think the results of the talks are not enough or the progress is not fast enough .</seg>
<seg id=603>the way i see it is that this round of talks was started under a situation where the related parties were lack of trust and differences in their stands were widening .</seg>
<seg id=604>the chinese government 's stand on the taiwan issue is always consistent and that is , it insists on the fundamental guiding principle of " peaceful reunification ; one country , two systems " .</seg>
<seg id=605>for this , we have tried our greatest efforts and showed our best sincerity . we have actually done a lot of work .</seg>
<seg id=606>however , the taiwan administration and the forces promoting " taiwan independence " are challenging our efforts .</seg>
<seg id=607>we respect taiwan people 's request for democracy , but we oppose any attempt by the taiwan administration and the forces for " taiwan independence " to organize " taiwan independence " activities under disguise of democracy . we oppose any separation of taiwan from the motherland .</seg>
<seg id=608>we want to protect the peace and stability in the taiwan strait region and that is why we have to clearly state our determination and our willpower to maintain the unification of the motherland .</seg>
<seg id=609>we have already said that we will try our best efforts to realize a reunification of the motherland in a peaceful way as long as a gleam of hope remains .</seg>
<seg id=610>we appreciate president bush 's reiteration of the one china stance , which sends a clear signal to the " taiwan independence " forces .</seg>
<seg id=611>the taiwan leadership claimed that " for the sake of preventing a military invasion by china and unilaterally change the current status across the strait , it is necessary to set into action the march 20 peace referendum " .</seg>
<seg id=612>this is defamation to mainland china 's peace efforts and provokes the relation between the two sides of the strait .</seg>
<seg id=613>at present , the real threat to taiwan safety does not come from the mainland but originates from taiwan administration 's active pursuit of separation activities in name of " taiwan independence " .</seg>
<seg id=614>the " taiwan independence " separation force is the direct cause of damage to current relation between two sides of the strait and endangers the peaceful situation in taiwan strait .</seg>
<seg id=615>the taiwan administration has twisted mainland 's opposition to separation by " taiwan independence " and mainland 's desire to maintain stability in taiwan strait as a suppression of democracy and freedom in taiwan . taiwan has used such an excuse to start the referendum .</seg>
<seg id=616>this is really to make something out of nothing , put right and wrong the other way round . the taiwan administration is attempting to obtain sympathy and support by cheating such as to continue pushing forward its separation route .</seg>
<seg id=617>the taiwan administration asserts that they are holding a so - called " preventive referendum " or " peace referendum " . no matter how it is to be packaged , this kind of provocation can only cause confrontation and hostility , escalating the intense relation between the two sides of the strait , and push the relation between two sides of the strait to the edge of danger .</seg>
<seg id=618>taiwan is proceeding in a totally opposite direction with taiwan compatriots ' mainstream public opinion for peace , stability and development . this is not deepening the taiwan " democracy " but mislead and manipulate the people of taiwan . it is also a serious threat to the peace and stability of asia pacific region and , as such , will receive widespread opposition from compatriots in two sides of the strait as well as the international community .</seg>
<seg id=619>an overview of progress and development of the chinese race in history tells us that unification is always the mainstream , irresistible general trend and the feelings of the people .</seg>
<seg id=620>as the motherland grows stronger everyday and cooperation between the two sides of the strait strengthen unceasingly , international community 's acceptance of one china has been further reinforced . any plot for separation is destined to fail .</seg>
<seg id=621>the chinese new year has been one of the traditional festivals highly valued by the chinese people and by now , it is only slightly more than 2 weeks away .</seg>
<seg id=622>in these bustling and joyful days , we are accustomed to gather together with relatives and best friends and exchange gifts to express our wishes .</seg>
<seg id=623>in accordance with the spirit of " linking people ; delivering business " , hong kong post starts to provide " hong kong / mainland gift fulfillment service " in collaboration with china post , which can help hong kong citizens to send their wishes and blessings to friends and relatives in hong kong or mainland china during the spring festival period .</seg>
<seg id=624>for a long time , hong kong post is devoted to cooperate with other postal institutions to provide international fulfillment services .</seg>
<seg id=625>since december 2002 , hong kong post has cooperated with australia post to launch a fulfillment service for western wines , which provides premium products to hong kong citizens .</seg>
<seg id=626>this time , we are in collaboration with china post , elevating the existing close cooperation in postal services , postal money order , and courier etc. to the cross border fulfillment service . directed at the increasing market demand by hong kong citizens to send gifts to relatives , friends and clients in mainland , we have launched this " hong kong / mainland gift fulfillment service " .</seg>
<seg id=627>the first batch of gifts includes several nicely packed gift sets for the chinese new year . the gift sets include selections of candies and nuts , tealeaves , dried seafood etc. and have a wide range of prices to suit your needs .</seg>
<seg id=628>they are very elegant gifts ; no matter you are sending them to relatives , friends or business partners .</seg>
<seg id=629>as we can all see , the consumer council has made many contributions to protect the rights of consumers over the past 30 years .</seg>
<seg id=630>if we want to evaluate the achievements of the consumer council , the best measure would be a check on any real improvement in consumer rights .</seg>
<seg id=631>i totally agree with what chairman chan has just said -- after 30 years , the consumers not only fully understand their rights now but all walks of life in our community have attached importance to consumer rights . this is clearly the fruitful result of efforts by consumer council and the government .</seg>
<seg id=632>the consumer council conducts regular testing on products and performs market research on products or services . it also studies the operations of various trades and professions . the council publishes fair and objective market information through its monthly magazine , the " choice " .</seg>
<seg id=633>the public has a lot of faith in the " choice " monthly magazine and the council is now working on a web version . this will enhance the magazine 's function and help consumer to acquire more up - to - date market information .</seg>
<seg id=634>the council has eleven regional consumer counsel centers and sixteen hotlines , which provide information on goods and services as well as accepting complaints from consumers .</seg>
<seg id=635>since the founding of the consumer council , it has received an ever - increasing numbers of inquiries - from several thousands cases at the time when it was established in the seventies to the 146,000 cases last year , an increase of twenty folds . that indicates more and more consumers refer to the council 's reports and opinions before choosing products and services</seg>
<seg id=636>furthermore , the consumer council has already processed more than 26,000 cases of complaints this year .</seg>
<seg id=637>the consumer council also publishes name of shops that employ improper gimmicks in their business . this can help consumers to watch out and not to be fooled . at the same time , it can also caution operators .</seg>
<seg id=638>legislator yeung , i told you before i have watched the television every carefully at the time of july 1 . i have done a lot of introspection thereafter . i can see citizens have demands , resentment and are not satisfied with the government 's policy .</seg>
<seg id=639>in this area , the government and i have strived to improve over the past six and seven months . we can see citizens are demanding the government to do a good job with the problems in the economy or people 's livelihood and we have made a lot of efforts in these areas . we also understand our citizens have many opinions against section 23 of the " basic law " and therefore , we have withdrawn section 23 . in fact , the government has made an instantaneous response .</seg>
<seg id=640>as to the demands for democracy in our society , i also understand it clearly .</seg>
<seg id=641>however , legislator yeung , i wish to tell you what i am doing today is to ensure every matter can proceed smoothly after the political review starts . therefore , we have to solve some basic problems first and this is a different thing all together .</seg>
<seg id=642>what are the basic problems ?</seg>
<seg id=643>some are problems of principle and some are problems in law . when the relevant rules in the political review involve the " basic law " , there will be whys and wherefores in interpretation . hence , it is necessary to do a good job in this area .</seg>
<seg id=644>we are doing this part of work and a three - men team has already commenced work .</seg>
<seg id=645>they will hold counsel with the central government and also listen to everyone 's opinion in hong kong . i think this is a good step and is a decision we arrived at after giving serious consideration to opinions in hong kong society .</seg>
<seg id=646>in today 's highly competitive commercial environment , brand name plays a crucial function to make products successful .</seg>
<seg id=647>to create a famous brand name , it is not a task that can be done in one morning or evening . it needs original design , high quality , thoughtful packaging , effective marketing and sustained investment .</seg>
<seg id=648>hong kong possesses the conditions to create famous brands .</seg>
<seg id=649>we possess the related know - how , technique and experience . we have a wealth of talents in everything from design , manufacture and marketing , right up to management . we also have access to a vast market .</seg>
<seg id=650>cepa became effective recently and will further enhance our advantage . apart from zero tariffs for exporting goods into mainland market , the best part of it is to stimulate merchants to think more and work hard to increase the value added in our products . such that our products can become famous brands adored by consumers in hong kong , mainland and even the whole world .</seg>
<seg id=651>cepa gives an impetus to hong kong products for migrating to the high value added path and , in this sense , the " hong kong top ten brand names awards " organized by chinese manufacturers ' association of hong kong happens to have the same idea by coincidence .</seg>
<seg id=652>in the past five - year , the awards have delivered fifty - one " hong kong top ten brand names " .</seg>
<seg id=653>nevertheless , fifty - one brand names are really nothing in view of the vast market in mainland . we need to have hundreds , thousands or even more " hong kong top brand names " .</seg>
<seg id=654>for many years , hong kong 's mass transit railway corporation has actively participated in various subway projects in major cities of the mainland and introduced their rich experience gained in hong kong to the mainland market in form of professional services .</seg>
<seg id=655>i am glad to note that the quality of hong kong 's investment , professional service and management skills are positively accepted in the mainland market .</seg>
<seg id=656>this type of exchange between shenzhen and hong kong will not only help develop our mother country but also create more development opportunities for hong kong merchants . in addition to the stimulation of the economy , it can help provide more employment opportunities in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=657>we have to thank the central government and shenzhen special economic zone government for their policy supports in many areas , without which we cannot possibly reach an agreement in principle for this project .</seg>
<seg id=658>this is the first investment outside hong kong for mass transit railway corporation . the participation in mainland subway development in form of an investment can help introduce more hong kong brand names to the mainland , which is obviously a delighted event to hong kong citizens and compatriots in mainland .</seg>
<seg id=659>i wish here that the shenzhen metro line 4 would receive a speedy official approval from central government and everything is smooth with the project 's engineering work . this event has laid a stronger foundation for more communication and cooperation between the two places of shenzhen and hong kong in the future .</seg>
<seg id=660>today is the fifth day of the lunar new year , i am very glad to be invited by the chinese gold & silver exchange to join your lunar new year gathering and preside the market reopen ceremony for the new year .</seg>
<seg id=661>first of all , i wish everyone a happy lunar new year . may everyone have the spirit of the dragon and the horse . may time have moved in your favor . may fortunes find their way to you and may all things that your heart desires come true .</seg>
<seg id=662>in the past one year , the price of gold surged significantly and has recently broken through the barrier of us $400 an ounce . the strong trend reflects that investors have regained confidence in gold .</seg>
<seg id=663>i believe your line of business was very busy in the past year .</seg>
<seg id=664>in fact , apart from external factors , the flourishing market also reflects the fruit of hard work by the chinese gold & silver exchange in past 90 years or so .</seg>
<seg id=665>this endeavor laid a solid foundation stone for hong kong 's gold market and has made numerous contributions to strengthen hong kong 's position as an international financial center .</seg>
<seg id=666>people say " the whole year 's work depends on a good start in spring " . i hope the members of chinese gold & silver exchange will continue with their hard work in the coming year and grasp the " golden " time for the gold and silver industry . it is also important to grasp the demand on gold trading brought forth by the reform in mainland gold market , our country 's accession to world trade organization and cepa . i hope everyone can continue to push ahead the development of the market .</seg>
<seg id=667>i believe with the active promotion by members of the exchange , the gold market in hong kong can show an extraordinary splendor in the coming year .</seg>
<seg id=668>finally , i wish an active trading in the gold market in the year of the monkey . all businesses can flourish and thrive .</seg>
<seg id=669>thank you ladies and gentlemen .</seg>
<seg id=670>nevertheless , past challenges are not limited to subsidized public housing . private housing is also full of serious ordeals .</seg>
<seg id=671>the outbreak of 1997 financial crisis has burst the asset bubble , causing property price to fall by 70 percent . property owners are hard hit , which was actually the main cause for the accelerated deflation in the past five years .</seg>
<seg id=672>the economy is turning good now and we are determined to maintain a stable environment to ensure steady development in our property market .</seg>
<seg id=673>a healthy property market is indeed important to a full recovery in hong kong economy .</seg>
<seg id=674>we are also committed to protect and improve our living environment .</seg>
<seg id=675>our work down the road is based on the principle of sustainable development . we will adopt better city planning and strengthen the protection of natural scenery and cultural relics in order to improve our living environment .</seg>
<seg id=676>we will double our attention to environmental problems .</seg>
<seg id=677>in last year , the sudden outbreak of " sars " reminds us that we must create spacious , clean and healthy living environment .</seg>
<seg id=678>we have to put in more efforts to beautify our environment -- plant more trees , build more parks and recreation facilities for the enjoyment of our citizens .</seg>
<seg id=679>i would like to take this opportunity to thank those members of the legislative council ( legco ) who expressed their opinions on the different sections of the chief executive 's " policy address " , including justice and legal , constitution , civil servants and staff of subsidized organizations , and public security .</seg>
<seg id=680>as to the justice and legal services area , only legislator margaret ng and legislator tsang yok - sing have made a statement and they are the chairman and vice chairman of the legco panel on the administration of justice and legal services .</seg>
<seg id=681>the chief executive has proposed several measures in the " policy address " to push ahead people - based governance , including the strengthening of communication between principal officials and the society ; conduct more public policy research ; strengthen cooperation between the government and legco ; and finally proceed with a solemn and serious review of the constitutional system .</seg>
<seg id=682>the department of justice will fully participate in the aforesaid works and strives to ensure all government measures conform to laws and procedures , especially the " basic law " , including the protection of basic rights and freedom to all citizens under the " basic law " . at the same time , the department will maintain its alertness , just as legislator margaret ng has said , in order to ensure hong kong is ruled by laws and the independence of judiciary system is maintained .</seg>
<seg id=683>as a principal official , i will strive to understand the opinions of the general public and the legal profession on issues affecting judicial affairs and the legal profession .</seg>
<seg id=684>for example , the " closer economic partnership arrangement " ( cepa ) is the fruitful result of close cooperation between the government and the profession , including the bar association , the law society of hong kong and the association of china - appointed attesting officers .</seg>
<seg id=685>we have successfully included " legal services " in cepa and rendered the profession an opened service industry in the mainland . this will provide a new platform to strengthen the cooperation between legal services in the two places and bring forth macro and long - term benefits to legal services in both places .</seg>
<seg id=686>the work of the task force is two - way . we will gather views from the hong kong community and reflect them to the central government .</seg>
<seg id=687>since middle of january this year , we have received more than ten organizations and individuals .</seg>
<seg id=688>everyone accepts completely that constitutional development in hong kong must conform to " one country , two systems " and hong kong is under direct jurisdiction of central government .</seg>
<seg id=689>the majority of them believe the constitutional system in hong kong needs improvement . at the same time , everyone also accepts any development must conform to the " basic law " .</seg>
<seg id=690>some organizations or individuals also have their own opinions on specific procedure or legal issue .</seg>
<seg id=691>the task force will convey their wishes , views and opinions to the central government in entirety .</seg>
<seg id=692>in the coming month and so , the task force will continue to receive other organizations and individuals . we will pass on all opinions that we are going to receive to the central government .</seg>
<seg id=693>this is only the first meeting of the task force with the relevant departments of the central government . in future , we still need to follow up and communicate more with the central government .</seg>
<seg id=694>i believe everyone understands that constitutional development involves the relationship between central government and the special administrative region . the central government also has the constitutional power and duty to examine and review constitutional development in the special administrative region . for this , we need to make adequate discussions with the central government .</seg>
<seg id=695>the west kowloon cultural district is a large scale arts and cultural program never undertaken in hong kong . its aim is not only to provide arts , culture and entertainment to hong kong citizens but also to improve the quality of the city and its citizens .</seg>
<seg id=696>the west kowloon cultural district development belongs to the entire hong kong society .</seg>
<seg id=697>the government will continue to explore the idea with all circles in the society such as to draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas .</seg>
<seg id=698>we understand that we are not only seeking tall and magnificent buildings . we need them to possess the necessary economic benefits , capable of sustained development , and capable of improving citizen 's quality of life .</seg>
<seg id=699>therefore , the government has attached high importance to the software required by the west kowloon cultural district to form a matching set . it is necessary to introduce related policy for facilities management , promotion strategy for cultural programs , contents of performance and exhibition , and propaganda strategy etc. etc.</seg>
<seg id=700>it is important to listen carefully to " users " opinion during the process of formulating these related policies .</seg>
<seg id=701>the younger generation -- including every young pal sitting here -- you are going to be one of the major users of west kowloon cultural district .</seg>
<seg id=702>we hope that the district can fit the old and the young ; can suit both refined and popular tastes . irrespective you are a hong kong citizen or a foreign tourist and irrespective you are the more mature one or an energetic youth , we hope you can linger in the district with no thought of leaving .</seg>
<seg id=703>i know that all of you have discussed the different issues of the west kowloon cultural district this morning . some students have also spent a lot of time in the past month and so to compile a special topic report . i believe all of you are now very familiar with the details of this program .</seg>
<seg id=704>i am extremely anxious to hear the conclusion of your discussions and look forward to exchange opinions with all of you .</seg>
<seg id=705>since the september 11 terrorist attacks , the focus of our world is on security at harbors , airports and borders .</seg>
<seg id=706>hong kong is shipping the highest number of containers to united states . as the number one port , hong kong has swiftly responded to the " container security initiative " brought up by u.s.</seg>
<seg id=707>furthermore , we deeply believe that cutting off the lifeline of terrorist organizations can be an effective curb on terrorist activities .</seg>
<seg id=708>for a long time , the massive inflow and outflow of funds through global financial system has been a nuisance to law enforcement agencies responsible for detection of money laundry and revenues derived from criminal activities .</seg>
<seg id=709>as a major financial centre in asia , we believe by cutting off the financial sources of terrorists would be the most effective method to strike out their structure or foundation .</seg>
<seg id=710>at present , legislative institution in hong kong is discussing various recommendations to tighten existing laws to curb any financial assistance to terrorist activities . hong kong is actively matching international standards and situations , for example , the new suggestion to set up a special financial affairs organization to combat money laundry activities , and we may amend our laws .</seg>
<seg id=711>furthermore , we are appealing for the set up of more comprehensive information disclosure laws such that related institutions or individuals may report suspicious transactions .</seg>
<seg id=712>" balance " is the key for any work in this area -- it is necessary to have sufficient power for effective investigation and at same time , there has to be appropriate constitutional protection for freedom , individual privacy , efficiency in our economic and financial systems . these are all factors that have to be considered .</seg>
<seg id=713>our regulatory measures must be based on law and orders , with high transparency , are fair and effective .</seg>
<seg id=714>in fact , hong kong 's service industries have advantages in many areas .</seg>
<seg id=715>hong kong 's talents in professional or commercial services have in depth understanding of commercial operations in mainland and overseas countries .</seg>
<seg id=716>hong kong 's professional services in accountancy , finance , law and arbitration will be mainland enterprises ' best partners as they become more internationalize and have to align with international markets .</seg>
<seg id=717>as to our transportation , construction , design and market promotion , management consulting , information technology , convention and exhibition services , they can help improve the overall productivity and competitiveness of mainland enterprises . they can also help formulate marketing strategy or improve brand images for enterprises and products .</seg>
<seg id=718>as to tourism , health care and insurance services , they can contribute to promote the development of related market and industries in mainland and help elevate the service quality .</seg>
<seg id=719>the close cooperation between service industries in the two places can greatly enhance their respective advantages and assist both sides to face the different types of opportunities and challenges brought forth by globalization .</seg>
<seg id=720>in order to promote the development of professional services in mainland market , the financial secretary and i , and together with representatives of different professions as well as officials of related policy bureaus and administrative authorities , have started useful and substantive discussions with related departments and equivalent units of the mainland on the mutual recognition of professional qualification and other topics of concerns to professionals in beijing last week .</seg>
<seg id=721>i am very glad that we signed the mutual recognition and cooperation agreement in the three professional areas of architect , structural engineers and insurance . this is an important step to enable the industries to explore the mainland market .</seg>
<seg id=722>through this meeting , the professional organizations in hong kong have established a closer connection with the supervising authorities in mainland and laid a good foundation for the next phase of friendly cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=723>i believe the majority of hong kong citizens love the mother country and love hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=724>in fact , hong kong and mainland have always maintained close economic , social , political , cultural relation and connections before or after the reunification . everything is closely linked to each other .</seg>
<seg id=725>on the economic front , we saw our nation started the four modernizations over twenty years ago and the promotion of reform and opening . hong kong industries had the opportunity to move north and enjoyed a new dimension in development . this had already tightened the relation between mainland and hong kong society .</seg>
<seg id=726>recently , we have another opportunity to finalize the closer economic partnership arrangement with the central government such that different service industries in hong kong can enjoy new opportunities ; can participate more actively and more broadly in the economic development in mainland . our service industries are now in a position to make useful contribution to our nation and to hong kong . at the same time , this will also tighten the relation between hong kong and mainland .</seg>
<seg id=727>in social development , we can see our country is making progress at a tremendous pace .</seg>
<seg id=728>hong kong citizens jumped for joy when they knew beijing 's bid for 2008 olympic games was successful .</seg>
<seg id=729>a few months ago , yang liwei visited hong kong and hong kong people also jumped for joy , but why ?</seg>
<seg id=730>it is because we feel our country has an achievement that every one of us , every citizen in hong kong can be proud of .</seg>
<seg id=731>i know the legislative council started discussions with the government regarding a long - term office location for the legislative council ten years ago .</seg>
<seg id=732>similarly , the government has been considering a long - term plan to relocate the central government offices for more than ten years .</seg>
<seg id=733>therefore , i understand that some members of the legislative council will definitely be disappointed by the government 's decision to postpone the tamar development project , which includes the new legislative council complex .</seg>
<seg id=734>i can understand that it is really great inconveniences for members of the legislative council to continue to work in less - than - desired environment during this period of time .</seg>
<seg id=735>however , just like what i told the colleagues in the government , who are equally affected by this decision , i hope everyone would put public interest as the major premise , understand the situation , and be patient during this period of time .</seg>
<seg id=736>earlier , i have already explained several times to the administrative management committee of the legislative council -- after consideration of the current financial status of the government and the financial status after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome last year , the government decided it is not the appropriate time to carry out the tamar project or any other large - scale office - building project .</seg>
<seg id=737>the government is to postpone the new legislative council complex situated at tamar site . this can help reduce the financial strain to the government in the next few years . it is also in the interest of the public and will be accepted by the public .</seg>
<seg id=738>the government will re-commence the development project of the tamar site and the new legislative council complex when the status of public finance improves . our existing plan is to do so .</seg>
<seg id=739>our nation cares very much about hong kong . the president and the premier also care very much about hong kong . i know they and the central government will do whatever possible to perfect the job in this area .</seg>
<seg id=740>so , it does not matter whether it is tourism , finance , infrastructure coordination , aviation rights , zero tariffs on products or service industries , i am sure good news will come one after another .</seg>
<seg id=741>after a recovery in hong kong 's economy , i also hope hong kong can make better use of its own advantage and make greater contribution to the development of our country .</seg>
<seg id=742>when i met with premier wen jiabao , i have congratulated him on behalf of hong kong for his work in a very difficult year . under his leadership , our country has achieved admirable results . even though there are still many challenges in the future , you have heard his work report . he is full of confidence and for that , we are truly inspired .</seg>
<seg id=743>premier wen has also told me to review mr. deng xiaoping 's important discussion twenty years ago on " one country , two systems " . it is useful for us to obtain a comprehensive and precise understanding of the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " . this can help our political system development down the road .</seg>
<seg id=744>he also told me that the people of hong kong should grasp this opportunity , concentrate our efforts to better develop the economy and do a good job in improving people 's livelihood . he is confident in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=745>later on , i will meet with mr. zhang dejiang , secretary of guangdong province , and mr. huang huahua , governor of guangdong province , and explore with them how to elevate our cooperation to a new level on top of the existing foundation and create a bigger win - win situation .</seg>
<seg id=746>the last point is " hong kong people ruling hong kong people " , which becomes all - too - familiar to everyone recently . this system relies on hong kong people , with patriots forming the main body , to manage hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=747>as to patriots , there is also a clear standard . the criteria for a patriot are to respect one 's own nation ; a hong kong citizen that sincerely support the nation 's resumption of sovereignty over hong kong ; and not to do any harm to the nation or hong kong . the main body of hong kong leadership should be comprised of patriots .</seg>
<seg id=748>i have to reiterate -- the vast majority of hong kong people are patriotic .</seg>
<seg id=749>we are not talking about the public in general here , but rather those people who participate in management of public affairs in hong kong , and those high - ranking individuals within the administrative structure , the legislative council and the judiciary .</seg>
<seg id=750>at the time when they sworn into office in accordance with the " basic law " , they have made clear their support for the " basic law " of hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china and have pledged loyalty to the people 's republic of china and the hong kong special administrative region .</seg>
<seg id=751>the five , six principles and important considerations that i just mentioned is a set of long - term policy and guiding principles developed when talks commenced in the eighties on the future of hong kong and at the time when the " joint declaration " and the " basic law " were formulated . it has not changed and it will not change because it is a series of long - term policy and guiding principles of our nation for the resumption of sovereignty rights over hong kong . it is a state policy and cannot be changed .</seg>
<seg id=752>since the intellectual property system was found several hundred years ago , it has fostered the creation of important inventions with epoch - making significance one after the other , especially after the industrial revolution .</seg>
<seg id=753>in the past twenty years , the intellectual property system has been the basic legal system and important policy measures to promote technology invention in different countries . the system plays an important role in the stimulation of economy and the strengthening of international competitiveness .</seg>
<seg id=754>nowadays , globalization , science and technology are advancing rapidly . the creation , possession and application of the wealth in knowledge and know - how , together with the number and quality of intellectual property in possession have become important bases for different countries to participate in international competition .</seg>
<seg id=755>therefore , we have to strengthen international communication and cooperation in the protection of intellectual property because it has an important meaning in the establishment of a rational and fair new order in international economies as well as the promotion of global economic prosperity and development .</seg>
<seg id=756>the chinese government has attached high importance to the protection of intellectual property .</seg>
<seg id=757>our country started to establish an intellectual property system at the beginning of the reform and opening . after over twenty years of endeavor , china has already brought into shape a relative complete legal system for intellectual property . china has also established an integrated intellectual property protection system comprised of judiciary and law enforcement agencies . china has done a lot of work in this area in order to make important contribution to promote scientific and technological progress as well as development in our society and economy .</seg>
<seg id=758>in the twenty - first century , mankind has migrated themselves into an information society . technology revolution has propelled productivity advancement in our society with unprecedented momentum in our society .</seg>
<seg id=759>it is necessary to further improve the intellectual property system in our country and strengthen international communication and cooperation in our work for the protection of intellectual property . this is a requirement for further opening of our country to foreigners in the new century . it is also a requirement for the construction of a modernized socialism society and the realization of a grand revival of the chinese race .</seg>
<seg id=760>we are willing to go alongside with other countries and build a fair and reasonable intellectual property system that can facilitate technology and economic development in all countries . we will strive to create a good environment where everyone on earth respects knowledge , admires science and protects intellectual property .</seg>
<seg id=761>the shanghai cooperation organization 's foremost task at this moment is to accelerate the systematic development of its organization .</seg>
<seg id=762>after the endeavor of various parties , the preparation work for a secretariat and a regional anti-terrorism institution has achieved significant progress .</seg>
<seg id=763>we need to make untiring efforts to ensure the secretariat can start this year and the regional anti-terrorism institution can be set up at an earlier date .</seg>
<seg id=764>in order to express our high respect to the shanghai cooperation organization and as the host country of the secretariat , the chinese government has decided to provide the office space for the secretariat free of charge .</seg>
<seg id=765>from now on , we will continue to provide strong support to ensure the secretariat can commence operations in a smooth way .</seg>
<seg id=766>one of the important tasks for shanghai cooperation organization is to deepen and expand cooperation in security area .</seg>
<seg id=767>there are " three stream of forces " seriously endangering the interests of member countries . we must not lower our alert and can never over - tolerate or accommodate them .</seg>
<seg id=768>we need to proceed with long - term untiring efforts to eradicate these vicious forces such as to realistically maintain peace and stability in the region .</seg>
<seg id=769>in order to cut off the capital source that may be used by the " three stream of forces " to finance their activities and also to initiate a more effective , more comprehensive attack on the " three stream of forces " , we must include the anti-drug problem into the schedule of security cooperation as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=770>economic cooperation is the important foundation and a priority for the shanghai cooperation organization .</seg>
<seg id=771>education is the cornerstone of modern civilization .</seg>
<seg id=772>to improve the quality of our nationals and to strengthen the overall national power , we must put in great efforts to develop education .</seg>
<seg id=773>education in rural villages has extensive influence and is affecting the overall economic development in both rural villages and our society .</seg>
<seg id=774>since the reform and opening , the appearance of cities and villages in our nation has gone through substantial and profound changes . this has a close connection with education , especially education in rural villages .</seg>
<seg id=775>after rural villages implemented the household contract responsibility system , productivity has been greatly enhanced .</seg>
<seg id=776>we can see that advance and practical technology are in widespread usage in agriculture ; township enterprise has suddenly emerged as a new force ; and surplus labor in rural areas can migrate in great numbers to coastal regions and cities . one of the fundamental cause for these phenomena is the solid foundation and support from hundreds of million in the rural labor force that have received the mandatory education . universal mandatory education has great accomplishments and its contribution could never be ignored .</seg>
<seg id=777>at present , the agriculture industry in our country and the rural economy are both situated at a critical juncture of development . there are urgent needs for all - round quality improvement in the labor force at rural villages because of the migration to high quality , high efficiency , ecology and safe agriculture ; expansion in the scale of operations in the agricultural industry ; and the transfer of rural surplus labor force .</seg>
<seg id=778>the technology revolution in the world and our migration towards a full - scale fairly prosperous society have imposed higher demands on the general rural population in terms of their scientific , cultural , ideological and moral quality .</seg>
<seg id=779>without the " 9 - year universal mandatory education " , there cannot be any all - round quality improvement for peasants and it would be difficult to realize a fairly prosperous society .</seg>
<seg id=780>we must fully recognize the function of rural education , including its foundation effect , leading nature and its overall role in the development of a full - scale fairly prosperous society .</seg>
<seg id=781>consultants and guests participating in this conference include senior leaders of multinationals , world-renowned economists , experts and scholars with profound attainments .</seg>
<seg id=782>i can deeply feel the sincere spirit in cooperation and the enthusiastic stand to deal with concrete matters offered by every consultant here .</seg>
<seg id=783>as we bring our cooperative spirit and collective wisdom into full play , we are not only benefiting the planning and promotion of guangdong developments but also benefiting our mutual efforts to advance our cooperation and development .</seg>
<seg id=784>i have been waiting for the arrival of the 2003 international consulting meeting on guangdong such that i can listen and understand your profound knowledge and penetrating insight about the economic and social development in guangdong .</seg>
<seg id=785>we are gathering happily here today for a common objective -- enhance cooperation and communication , explore development opportunity such as to add vitality to the economic and social development in guangdong and , of course , also create opportunity for your career development .</seg>
<seg id=786>china has joined the world trade organization , which symbolizes its migration to a completely new phase of opening to foreigners . we are participating in international competition on a wider scope , in a wider range of areas and at a higher level .</seg>
<seg id=787>guangdong is the province within the mainland economy that is most opened to foreigners . it has taken the lead and experienced an unprecedented development opportunities as well as rigorous challenges .</seg>
<seg id=788>against such a macro background , we must firmly grasp new opportunities and face new challenges . it is necessary to raise international competitiveness across the broad and enthusiastically push ahead the modernization process . we should strive to initiate new prospects of economic cooperation . we need to complement each other 's advantages , pursuit mutual benefits , cooperate on a long - term basis and seek common developments .</seg>
<seg id=789>the people of guangdong are concentrating their attention to build a full - scale fairly prosperous society . guangdong is accelerating its modernization and this will bring more development opportunities and rooms for every friend .</seg>
<seg id=790>guangdong 's economy is full of vitality and has a bring future . it is powerfully poised to stride across another new high .</seg>
<seg id=791>iraq 's governing council has signed an agreement with u.s. occupying forces a few days ago . they announced a phased timetable for the power transfer to the people of iraq by june next year .</seg>
<seg id=792>this agreement has received the reluctant validation by international community -- even though the foreign minister of european union welcomed the agreement , france believe " the process is too slow " . united nations secretary general annan is inspired by the " plan to transfer power " but at the same time , he thinks , " the opportune moment is not ripe yet " for united nations to play a role in iraq . russia has simply challenged the legality of the agreement .</seg>
<seg id=793>the people of iraq are indifferent to the agreement ; u.s. public opinions even consider the agreement " a major gamble " .</seg>
<seg id=794>anyhow , most people are between believing and suspicion . most of them are adopting a wait and see attitude .</seg>
<seg id=795>it is not without reason that international community has so many doubts about it .</seg>
<seg id=796>people can see that u.s. is not really willing to return sovereignty to people of iraq . therefore , the transfer of political power may not be thorough and it is likely to have a lot of hidden issues .</seg>
<seg id=797>first , the transitional government scheduled to be formed in may next year is not derived from direct election . instead , it is elected by the " transitional national assembly " , which , in turn , is elected by 18 election committees at provincial level .</seg>
<seg id=798>inevitably , people may think u.s. controls the process and its legitimacy might be challenged .</seg>
<seg id=799>second , u.s. announced that u.s. troops would not withdraw even after the power transfer . effectively , they are just changing from " occupying forces " to " existing forces " only .</seg>
<seg id=800>u.s. government announced on november 18 its decision to start imposing quotas on three kinds of textile products , namely stockinet , brassiere and gown .</seg>
<seg id=801>at a time when china strives to expand sino - u.s. cooperation in economy and trade , u.s. government 's protective measure has certainly made everyone felt sorry .</seg>
<seg id=802>with globalization developed to its current status , it is certainly out of time for u.s. to re-impose quotas on chinese textile products .</seg>
<seg id=803>first , such abuse of " quota " restricts the thorough implementation of world trade organization 's free trade principle .</seg>
<seg id=804>on one hand , u.s. is talking in high - sounding tone about " free trade " . on the other hand , it re-establishes trade barriers and stabs your back at will with " quotas " . does it appear too arbitrary and unfair ?</seg>
<seg id=805>second , " quota " limits the nice growth trend in sino - america trade relation .</seg>
<seg id=806>since china and u.s. reached an agreement for china to join the world trade organization in 1999 , import from u.s. is increasing at 15 percent a year on average .</seg>
<seg id=807>in january to september this year , china 's import from u.s. has increased 26.2% over corresponding period .</seg>
<seg id=808>in the past two years , china 's import of textile materials and garments from u.s. has increased rapidly .</seg>
<seg id=809>in fact , u.s. export to china is increasing at the fastest rate amongst all of its trading partners .</seg>
<seg id=810>bush 's visit to britain failed to meet his wishes and there are many reasons for that . the most important one is that u.s. became the sole superpower in the world after the conclusion of the cold war and it simply turns blind eyes to others as its unilateralism expands .</seg>
<seg id=811>united states has launched the war against iraq without united nations authorization . it shows no respect for the opinions of its main allies on major international issues including , for example , the iraq reconstruction . u.s. persists in its own way and has provoked public anger .</seg>
<seg id=812>a poll recently released by the commission of european union shows 68 percent of the citizens in european union believe u.s. do not have adequate reasons for its war against iraq and 53 percent think u.s. constitutes a threat to world peace .</seg>
<seg id=813>second , united states emphasizes on anti-terrorism . it asks its allies to contribute human resources and financial means but it pays no attention to matters that its allies care about .</seg>
<seg id=814>the united states has grasped iraq 's reconstruction projects tightly in its hand . the main contracts in the first tender were all given to its own companies and nothing was given to others . for the dispute over steel , the world trade organization has made a ruling that the high u.s. levy is against regulation . the commerce and industrial sector in britain hopes that bush would make some concessions in this trip but in the end , bush did not clearly declare his stand .</seg>
<seg id=815>third , united states regards its concept of value as the highest norm , which overrides concepts of all other countries . it insists to impose democratic reforms in middle east countries but has encountered reproaches . some allies demanded that united states should respect iraq 's islamic culture and characteristics . they believe one of the reasons why u.s. troop was bogged down in quagmire in iraq is the bitter fruit of " disrespect " .</seg>
<seg id=816>however , bush would not mend his own ways just because of widespread criticism and opposition . during his visit , he once again defended his iraq policy , emphasizing the u.s. - britain coalition forces would continue to cope with violent events inside iraq by force .</seg>
<seg id=817>since bush 's visit to britain failed to meet his wishes , the situation in iraq would not necessarily develop in the direction as the white house wishes .</seg>
<seg id=818>after lengthy debates over the past six months , an advance detachment of japan 's self-defense forces has departed for iraq at the end of 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=819>this is the first time that japan sends soldiers to a foreign battleground since the end of world war ii .</seg>
<seg id=820>it reflects japan 's wish to migrate towards a political and military super power and signifies a change in japan 's defense strategy .</seg>
<seg id=821>the self-defense forces ' trip arouses attention because it is not an isolated incident .</seg>
<seg id=822>japan took the opportunity of the afghanistan war and made a breakthrough deployment of self-defense forces to a foreign country . japan used the korean peninsula problem and passed the " war contingency laws " , which foreshadows the use of force or even preemptive attack by self-defense forces . recently , koizumi 's cabinet made preparation for troop deployment to iraq through " the basic plan on reconstruction in iraq " .</seg>
<seg id=823>one step after another , japan has finally overcome the restriction of its constitution and succeeded in dispatching soldiers to foreign combat fields .</seg>
<seg id=824>furthermore , japan is preparing to amend its " concept of basic defense force " in 2004 such as to legalize the deployment of japanese troops to a foreign country and make that a permanent arrangement . japan also intends to send " permanent force " , which is not temporarily assembled , to overseas countries .</seg>
<seg id=825>meanwhile , the japanese cabinet has used the so - called " north korea missile threat " as a reason and decided to commence the deployment of national missile defense program from the beginning of 2004 . japan will import u.s. made " standard missile 3 " and " patriot 3 " missiles , which can intercept missiles outside and re-entering the earth 's atmosphere respectively and thus building a double interception system .</seg>
<seg id=826>it is not difficult to see japan 's self-defense forces are developing the " combined capability of attack and defense " and the so - called " self-defense forces " specializing in " passive defense " will exist in name only .</seg>
<seg id=827>japan 's movement has raised concerns because these military policies impact japan 's pacifist constitution .</seg>
<seg id=828>koizumi has made a formal visit to the yasukuni shrine and he defended his behavior during an interview by reporters .</seg>
<seg id=829>however , his argument is contradicting and full of loopholes .</seg>
<seg id=830>reporters asked koizumi why he is visiting the shrine . koizumi replied , " japan 's peace and prosperity are realized on the foundation of sacrifices in the war .</seg>
<seg id=831>i am making a formal visit to pray for peace and prosperity in japan . "</seg>
<seg id=832>we would like to ask : does koizumi 's so - called " sacrifices in war " include class - a war criminals in word war ii like hideki tojo etc. ?</seg>
<seg id=833>can we say that japan 's peace and prosperity after the war are also based on contributions from class - a war criminals ?</seg>
<seg id=834>some reporters asked why he chose january 1 to visit the yasukuni shrine ?</seg>
<seg id=835>koizumi said a formal visit to a shrine on the first day of a new year is japan 's confucian orthodoxy . in fact , many people would pay a formal visit to a shrine on that day .</seg>
<seg id=836>it is understandable that many ordinary people would like to remember their family members or friends . in fact , many distressed relatives are making it clear that they are visiting the yasukuni shrine in memory of their family members or friends and they strongly oppose any class - a war criminals be enshrined in the yasukuni shrine .</seg>
<seg id=837>the people of china are willing to listen to reasons . all along , we insist to separate the people of japan from a small group of militarists . we need to separate ordinary people from right - wing extremists . ordinary citizens visiting the yasukuni shrine are not the crux of this history problem .</seg>
<seg id=838>unity is strength .</seg>
<seg id=839>this is an indestructible truth .</seg>
<seg id=840>in order to realize the grand objective of building a full - scale fairly prosperous society and accomplish the holy undertaking for a great revival of the chinese people , we must unite all forces available .</seg>
<seg id=841>in a new century and in a new phase , the work of the patriotic united front and the people 's political consultative conference must use this as the basic start off and stop over points .</seg>
<seg id=842>we must adhere to and perfect the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system led by the chinese communist party . we must further strengthen and develop the patriotic united front . we must fully mobilize all positive factors on all fronts and add power unceasingly to the great revival of the chinese people .</seg>
<seg id=843>in the past one year , the people 's political consultative conference has firmly grasped the two main themes of unity and democracy . it has conscientiously fulfilled its different functions in order to promote a comprehensive development in our economy and our society . it has played an important role to protect the overall stability of our reform and development .</seg>
<seg id=844>in the new year , we hope the people 's political consultative conference will closely encircle the party and the center of the country and do an even better job in political consultation , democratic supervision , participation and discussion of politics . the conference should enhance the fine points in confucian orthodoxy , bringing our advantages into play and perform in - depth study and research . the conference should actively provide advice and policy suggestion such as to make new and better contribution in the construction of a full - scale fairly prosperous society .</seg>
<seg id=845>the head of state meeting for the 12th south asian association for regional cooperation ( saarc ) was held january 4-6 in islamabad after a delay for a full year . the meeting approved several documents , including " south asian free trade framework agreement " , " additional protocol to saarc on suppression of terrorism " , " social charter for south asia " etc. , and announced that members of saarc will strive for common development and cooperation in economy , culture and anti-terrorism .</seg>
<seg id=846>during the saarc summit , the bilateral meeting of indian prime minister vajpayee and pakistani president musharraf was especially conspicuous .</seg>
<seg id=847>in the last summit , vajpayee and musharraf shook their hands but that did not give people too much hope to the relation development between the two countries .</seg>
<seg id=848>after two years , tensions between the two countries eased up following a series of important measures including resumption of normal foreign relations , resumption of land and air traffic , and cease - fire in kashmir region etc. finally , the two sides have taken the opportunity in the south asia summit and realized a meeting at the top .</seg>
<seg id=849>the two countries have taken another stride forward in the process of improving their bilateral relation , which is a favorable turn for cooperation in south asia region .</seg>
<seg id=850>notwithstanding india 's foreign minister sinha said on the 4th that the meeting was of " ceremonial nature " , most people believe the meeting means india and pakistan relation is heading for a more positive and practical direction .</seg>
<seg id=851>the leaders of both countries have recognized that tensions and hostility are not in the interests of their nations . on the other hand , they are missing economic development opportunities time after time .</seg>
<seg id=852>as globalization intensifies , the urgent tasks of the two governments are to revive their economies and strengthen their cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=853>despite official result of the presidential election in georgia on the 4th has yet to be revealed , it looks the victory of saakashvili , a candidate jointly supported by right wing parties and the leader of national movement , is the inevitable outcome .</seg>
<seg id=854>the central election commission of georgia said on the 7th that , in the 89% of votes already counted , over 95% of the voters supported saakashvili .</seg>
<seg id=855>some heads of the commonwealth of independent states have already sent congratulatory telegrams to this young politician .</seg>
<seg id=856>actually , saakashvili has already proclaimed victory himself as early as the night that the voting ended .</seg>
<seg id=857>he claimed the result of the polls is a " victory of the people " and said georgia will take some rapid actions to create its own future .</seg>
<seg id=858>in interviews by media , many voters said they cast their votes to saakashvili for the purposes of choosing a " new hope " .</seg>
<seg id=859>even the former president shevardnadze , who was forced to resign , expressed support to this political rival of the old days and praised saakashvili as " young , energetic and well educated " .</seg>
<seg id=860>at the same time of putting hopes on saakashvili , people also noticed that there were no major changes in georgia 's situation after shevardnadze 's resignation two months ago .</seg>
<seg id=861>we can say that the newly elected president is still facing the same old problems .</seg>
<seg id=862>the past year was an important but unusual year in the development process of our country .</seg>
<seg id=863>we have fought the sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome with extreme hardships and difficulties but we finally achieved a great victory at that stage . the economy in our country continued to maintain a nice growth trend . we have climbed another step as the average per capita production surged above 1,000 u.s. dollars . the " shenzhou 5 " manned space flight was concluded with great success and the chinese people 's dream on space flights has been realized . our nationals are untied , the society is progressing and people 's livings are better than before .</seg>
<seg id=864>the achievements of our country in many areas have become the focus of world attention . everyone in the country has contributed tremendous efforts and is showing courage and strength to create miracle . no one is scared of hardships or dangers .</seg>
<seg id=865>looking into the new year , we are full of confidence and wishes .</seg>
<seg id=866>judging from the overall domestic and international situations , our country is situated at an important strategic opportunity period that we must tightly grasp and make maximum use of it .</seg>
<seg id=867>we have to adhere to deng xiaoping 's theories and the important guiding thoughts of " three represents " . we have to thoroughly put into effect the spirit of the 16th cpc national congress and the 16th communist party congress . we must conscientiously implement the major policies and overall plans of the central government for this year . we must continue to push ahead reform , opening , modernization and development .</seg>
<seg id=868>in order to do this year 's job properly , we must correctly grasp the circumstances . it is necessary to visualize favorable conditions , new opportunities as well as unfavorable conditions and new challenges . we have to increase our sense of responsibility , our sense of urgency and our sense of concern .</seg>
<seg id=869>a three - party meeting on the iraq problem was held in united nations ' new york headquarters on the 19th and annan , the secretary general of united nation ( un ) , exchanged views with representatives from iraq 's governing council and u.s. - britain coalition provisional authority . their discussions focused on how un can play a role in iraq 's reconstruction .</seg>
<seg id=870>the three sides have exchanged views candidly and the discussion involved politics , humanity and security issues in iraq as well as the appointment of a special un representative to be stationed in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=871>u.s. - britain is at a critical juncture where their plan to transfer power in iraq might be boycotted . as a result , people are watching attentively whether and how un may involve in the reconstruction of iraq .</seg>
<seg id=872>since u.s. announced that the main war in iraq has ended in early may last year , the situation in iraq continues to be unstable . attacks came one after the other as protests against the occupation and are causing countless casualties to the u.s. - britain coalition . there is hardly any peaceful day .</seg>
<seg id=873>the former president of iraq , saddem hussein , was captured on december 13 last year but the joy in u.s. failed to endure . the security situation in iraq has not improved . resistance activities have intensified and are pushing the occupying forces into a difficulty position .</seg>
<seg id=874>on the other hand , the people of iraq and arab countries have unanimously demanded foreign troops to leave and return sovereignty to iraq , thus allowing the people of iraq to manage their own country .</seg>
<seg id=875>meanwhile , u.s. and britain are making every effort to re-mold the iraq regime according to their wishes because on such a foundation , they can gradually extricate themselves from this quagmire " in an elegant way " .</seg>
<seg id=876>for this purpose , the process and the model of power transfer have become the focus of iraq affairs at this time .</seg>
<seg id=877>the tentative plan brought up by u.s. - britain provisional authority and iraq 's governing council in november last year is : a transitional government is to be formed before july 1 this year through an election in the " transitional national assembly " but " provincial election committee " nominates the representatives to attend the assembly .</seg>
<seg id=878>iraq 's shiite , which accounts for the majority of the population , stressed that a nationwide direct election is the fair way to return sovereignty to iraq .</seg>
<seg id=879>u.s. secretary of state powell 's visit to russia is still a conspicuous focal point of public opinions .</seg>
<seg id=880>this is because of decisive roles played by u.s. and russia . their relation may have a profound impact to the modern world .</seg>
<seg id=881>more important , powell 's moscow trip is full of practical contents and has transmitted a clear signal -- as far as russia - u.s. relation is concerned , there is a dark cloud over the sky .</seg>
<seg id=882>if this dark cloud is not promptly dissipated , the future relation of two countries may turn dim .</seg>
<seg id=883>despite the channel for dialogue between washington and moscow is clear , powell has decided to clarify his position through an article in russia 's influential newspaper , the " izvestia " .</seg>
<seg id=884>powell said in the article that u.s. is confused by a series of events in russia 's internal affairs and foreign affairs over the past few months .</seg>
<seg id=885>he is of the opinion that the russian administration is not totally accepting the restrains of legal system and its position in certain crucial factors of a democratic society is not firm , including freedom of information and political party development .</seg>
<seg id=886>u.s. is especially disturbed by russia 's policy in chechen and its attitude towards the neighboring commonwealth of the independent states .</seg>
<seg id=887>to diplomats , the use of public media to declare one 's stand is considered the " last mode " of communication .</seg>
<seg id=888>the original intention for u.s. to make such a choice is pregnant with meaning but the embarrassment and dissatisfaction on the russia side is obvious to everyone .</seg>
<seg id=889>( international ) flu outbreak in u.s. reaches new high</seg>
<seg id=890>xinhua news agency , los angeles , december 31st ( reporter : yan liang ) - the centers for disease control and prevention indicated on december 31st that the worst flu outbreak not seen in u.s. for 30 years has reached a new high . among the 50 states in u.s. , 45 of them have reported widespread of flu and the death cases caused by flu are increasing rapidly .</seg>
<seg id=891>according to the center 's statistics to december 20th , 7.8% of total death cases in america was attributed to flu , which was a record high .</seg>
<seg id=892>at least 42 children have died from flu complications in u.s. and the death cases among adults have also gone up rapidly . however , it is impossible to have the exact figure at the moment .</seg>
<seg id=893>experts believed that there are two reasons for the serious outbreak of flu in 2003 : first , last year 's prevailing " panama strain a " is no longer the predominant flu virus this year , which renders vaccines made earlier an ineffective protection ; second , owing to last year 's overproduction in flu vaccines , the two major vaccine producers reduced this year 's production to 83 million doses and hence , effectively created a shortage in supply this year .</seg>
<seg id=894>the social unrest caused by this flu outbreak is rarely seen despite on average 36,000 people died and about 114,000 people hospitalized for flu - related complications each year in u.s.</seg>
<seg id=895>mr. william thompson , a u.s. epidemiologist , believed that this is the worst flu outbreak for u.s. in 30 years . flu has come earlier than usual this year and is already widespread in many schools causing long queues in many flu vaccination centers .</seg>
<seg id=896>under such severe circumstances , u.s. department of health has activated its emergency operations center on december 19th and dispatched teams of health specialists to every state to cope with the situation .</seg>
<seg id=897>recently , there are outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza one after another in some regions of our country .</seg>
<seg id=898>party 's central committee ( pcc ) and government administration council ( gac ) have attached high importance to this . they swiftly made a series of important decisions and brought up clear , definite guiding principles , measures and policy for prevention and control .</seg>
<seg id=899>related local authorities and departments have taken urgent actions and , in accordance with pcc and gac deployment , are sparing no efforts to stop the epidemic disease from spreading .</seg>
<seg id=900>at present , intense prevention and control work are proceeding in a systematic manner across the nation to combat the avian flu .</seg>
<seg id=901>the highly pathogenic avian flu is a type of animal epidemic disease that can spread rapidly and causes great harm to animals . the disease may seriously endanger the production in livestock industry as well as the health and safety of the public .</seg>
<seg id=902>it is important to perfect the work in prevention and control of the highly pathogenic avian flu because it affects public health and safety ; affects the development of agriculture and farmers ' income ; affects overall economic development ; and affects the stability of our society . all regions and departments should be guided by the important thought of " three represents " and operate in accordance with the requirement of the " animal epidemic prevention law of the peoples ' republic of china " . all regions and departments should strengthen their leadership , operate in close coordination , base on scientific knowledge and in accordance with law , including group prevention and group control . authorities should be decisive in actions in order to be highly responsible to the public . officials must conscientiously implement the different prevention and control measures . every one must have the determination to win this blocking action of avian flu .</seg>
<seg id=903>as the largest debtor country in the world , united states ' foreign debt is on the rise again .</seg>
<seg id=904>u.s. treasury department announced on january 16 that the country owes a total of 6.494 trillion u.s. dollars to all kinds of foreign creditors , 2.2 percent higher than the previous announcement .</seg>
<seg id=905>on average , every american shares a debt of over twenty thousand u.s. dollars .</seg>
<seg id=906>as a coincidence , international monetary fund released a research report just a week earlier , which sounded the warning bell , in a sharp and systematically way , against america 's faltering financial base . the report pointed out the country 's external debt , which keeps on hitting new records , has grown to an extent that threatens the global financial stability .</seg>
<seg id=907>statistics show that foreign private investors are holding some 40 percent of all u.s. government bonds .</seg>
<seg id=908>this reminds us the idea presented by keynes to president roosevelt in the first half of the 20th century -- adopt a deficit policy to stimulate economy at home and borrow money from other countries to make up for the shortfall .</seg>
<seg id=909>the measure did play an important role to stimulate " effective demand " and could ease a financial crisis as pressing as a fire singeing one 's eyebrows .</seg>
<seg id=910>however , people can see many american administrations followed the same measure and taken it as a " miraculous cure " .</seg>
<seg id=911>since president reagan called for tax cut and arms expansion in the eighties of the twentieth century , u.s. fiscal deficits are increasing gradually and eventually turned u.s. into the biggest debtor nation .</seg>
<seg id=912>the convention of the first round six - party talks was an important step forward for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear problem in korean peninsula through dialogue .</seg>
<seg id=913>in the first round of talks , the different sides have come to some common points . the meeting laid down the necessary foundation for future talks and also further clarified the objective , route and guiding principle to resolve the nuclear problem in korean peninsula .</seg>
<seg id=914>in the past several months , the relevant sides have all insisted to resolve the nuclear problem in korean peninsula peacefully through dialogue . based on the foundation of the results of first round of talks , different sides have proceeded with a wide range of coordination and discussions at different levels such as to contribute untiring efforts to hold the second round meeting at an earlier date .</seg>
<seg id=915>meanwhile , north korea and u.s. have also shown more flexibility at various levels .</seg>
<seg id=916>right now , the preparation work for more talks have achieved important progress and a good meeting is what everybody wants .</seg>
<seg id=917>the relevant sides and the international community are all following with interest on issues like what kind of results can be achieved in the second round talks , or whether the peace process can continue .</seg>
<seg id=918>for this , a spokesman of china 's ministry of foreign affairs said the objective of the six - party talks is to maintain dialogue and push ahead the peace process . china is willing to work jointly with other parties on this objective .</seg>
<seg id=919>china 's starting point is to maintain peace and stability in the korean peninsula and realize denuclearization in the peninsula .</seg>
<seg id=920>china believes if all parties to the meeting maintain their sincerity , respect each other , and consult each other on the basis of equality , then that would create favorable conditions for the resolution of the related problem .</seg>
<seg id=921>u.s. - libya relation deteriorated at the end of seventies in the last century and the two countries terminated diplomatic relation in 1981 .</seg>
<seg id=922>u.s. president reagan has drawn up a list of accusations against the libyan leader qadhafi including secret development of nuclear weapons , military interference in foreign countries and terrorism etc.</seg>
<seg id=923>the quarrel between the two sides had finally turned into warfare . u.s. launched two surgical - type air raids on libya , code - named " operation prairie fire " and " operation el dorado canyon " .</seg>
<seg id=924>thereafter , u.s. imposed economic sanction on libya and attacked libya on the political front , suppressed it in foreign affairs and continued to threaten the country militarily .</seg>
<seg id=925>however , qadhafi did not give in under the heavy pressure .</seg>
<seg id=926>at present , u.s. - libya relation has improved . some people have given credit to the effect of the iraq war , which terrorize others by military force , but that might be a biased judgment .</seg>
<seg id=927>in fact , for many years , the peculiar character qadhafi has been contending u.s. on one hand but on the other hand , he was also throwing branches of the olive tree towards u.s. regrettably , libya has not received any response from u.s.</seg>
<seg id=928>after the iraq war ended , the different sides in middle east have adjusted their strategy . the redistribution of power in the region has provided a turning point for the resumption of diplomatic relation between u.s. and libya .</seg>
<seg id=929>to qadhafi , the cultivation of friendship with u.s. can terminate the economic sanction . libya can then develop vigorously its economy , improves the living of its people , breaks away from isolation and blends into international community .</seg>
<seg id=930>by giving up something that libya has never achieved and cannot achieve in a short time , libya can migrate into a new environment and no wonder people sometimes say , " past the dark willows and flowers in bloom lies another village " .</seg>
<seg id=931>in february 7 - 8 , important political figures from europe , u.s. and other regions in the world gathered in munich of germany to attend the 44th munich conference on security policy .</seg>
<seg id=932>the so - called " munich conference on security policy " is a forum for international security issues organized by a non-governmental institution in germany but sponsored by the german government . in recent years and especially after " september 11 " , more and more people are starting to attach importance to the event and it is praised as " davos forum " for security .</seg>
<seg id=933>one of the important topics for discussion in this meeting is the cross atlantic relation .</seg>
<seg id=934>judging from the words of political figures during meetings and off meetings , both sides are trying hard to get rid of the shadows to their relation cast by the iraq war and strive to return to the path of cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=935>bertram , head of berlin 's institute for international politics and security , said that the meeting is an occasion for u.s. and europe to repair their relation and both sides are showing desire to line up again with each other .</seg>
<seg id=936>for europe - u.s. relation , the new message from the meeting is that europe and u.s. need some new dialogue . they have to seriously consider the common mission faced by them and identify the convergent point of interests in fulfilling these missions .</seg>
<seg id=937>in contrast to the meeting last year , this year is not explosive at all and the stands of both sides are close .</seg>
<seg id=938>the " old europe " represented by france and germany are still deeply concerned at heart about the u.s. war against iraq but indicated the necessity to " look ahead " .</seg>
<seg id=939>german foreign minister fischer said in the meeting , " despite our view on the war is different , we still need to jointly ensure iraq has peace after the war and for this , we must look ahead " .</seg>
<seg id=940>he further said germany will not send soldiers to iraq but germany does not intend to block nato from playing a direct role in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=941>u.s. has grabbed the early opportunities in modern mass media and monopolizes the rights to speak in a fairly large portion of international news . its public opinions and propaganda are reaching out to the whole world ; virtually to a level that it can get in by every opening . and now , why does u.s. bother to put in huge sums to set up a special satellite television station to cover the 22 countries in middle east ?</seg>
<seg id=942>to use the words of the person in charge at " the free one " television , u.s. is trying to provide arabian countries with a news platform featuring " fair and all - round viewpoint " .</seg>
<seg id=943>nevertheless , analysts pointed out that " the free one " is u.s. strategic weapon to permeate into public opinions of arabian countries . it is a cultural invasion and a psychological attack plan . it is u.s. propaganda machine to help push ahead the integration in middle east and an attempt to reform the policy in islamic world .</seg>
<seg id=944>judging from this , " the free one " has unusual missions . if we select the most important ones , there are roughly three of them : first , to broadcast the " free concept " .</seg>
<seg id=945>u.s. believes the islamic civilization is a serious obstruction to the promotion of modern civilization by western world . the extreme religious forces in islamic countries in middle east are breeding grounds for international terrorism with an anti-america characteristic . it is necessary to reform the islamic world in order for anti-terrorism to be effective . it is necessary to make the islamic world recognize and accept western values , living style and political systems .</seg>
<seg id=946>u.s. is attempting to change and influence arabians unobtrusively and imperceptibly by inculcating its ideology through programs on " the free one " .</seg>
<seg id=947>second , to improve the image of united states .</seg>
<seg id=948>u.s. is adopting unilateralism in its foreign affairs . in a series of international issues , u.s. has been inordinately proud of its strength and persists in its own way . its high - handed actions have caused resentment and complaints from arabian countries and the islamic world .</seg>
<seg id=949>since the " september 11 " incident , america 's consistent undue favor for israel has intensified its contradiction with the islamic world in middle east .</seg>
<seg id=950>u.s. has used anti-terrorism and elimination of mass destruction weapon as an excuse and invaded iraq without any concrete evidence or authorization from united nations . its act has provoked strong resentment from the muslim public .</seg>
<seg id=951>the peace hope in south asia subcontinent has risen again as pakistani and indian officials held talks on february 16 - 18 in islamabad .</seg>
<seg id=952>the officials of the two countries have established the mechanism for continued dialogue down the road , including a confirmed schedule and model of the talks . this symbolizes the restart of the dialogue process between pakistan and india after an interruption of two years and has paved a foundation for the two countries to sort out gradually all the questions hanging in the air , including the kashmir dispute . it is also a realization of their precious sincerity for peace .</seg>
<seg id=953>before this talk , many analysts are still very conservative about the future of the peace process , despite a series of good intentions exhibited by both sides have already warmed up their relation .</seg>
<seg id=954>this is not to be blamed given the rapid ups and downs in pakistan - india relation over the past few years . it looks as if no one dares to guarantee anything -- the sunshine illuminates on the negotiation table today may turn into thunder and lightning at the border tomorrow .</seg>
<seg id=955>nevertheless , when pakistan foreign secretary riaz khokhar read out the joint statement of the two nations with a smiling face on the 18th , optimistic feelings are permeating for another time . suddenly , a new light shines into the eyes of those who have been watching the south asia situation for a long period of time .</seg>
<seg id=956>first , the timetable agreed in the meeting is feasible and both sides have not only confirmed the specific schedule and topics for meeting but also assigned levels to different talks in accordance with the importance of the topic involved .</seg>
<seg id=957>second , both sides have learned from the failure in the agra summit back in july 2001 , in which direct dialogue between leaders of the two countries had led to a total failure of the meeting . this time , the dialogue will use a " step - by - step " model . talks will start from a low level and gradually move to higher levels such as to make sufficient preparation for dialogue at senior level .</seg>
<seg id=958>in addition , after the several ups and downs in bilateral relation between the two countries , both sides are now in unanimity that war is not a good solution for problems and one should better stay away from it . this common consensus has laid a foundation for the leaders of the two countries to reach an understanding of " no more war between pakistan and india " some time in the future .</seg>
<seg id=959>in order to understand precisely and carry through the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " , it is necessary to link " one country " to " two systems " and " patriotic to nation " with " patriotic to hong kong " . the admiration for a highly autonomous hong kong has to be linked to the maintenance of sovereignty in our country . the continuation of capitalism in hong kong has also to be linked to the socialism advocated by our country .</seg>
<seg id=960>it is only then can hong kong compatriots ' wellbeing be realistically protected and everything conforms to the long - term interests of our nation and its people .</seg>
<seg id=961>since the reunification of hong kong , the central government is determined to adhere to the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " and has handled all affairs strictly according to the basic law .</seg>
<seg id=962>the vast majority of compatriots in hong kong are enjoying unprecedented democratic rights in the position as a host .</seg>
<seg id=963>with the strong support from central government and the motherland , hong kong has overcome various risks and challenges , including the impacts of the asian financial crisis . hong kong continues to maintain its position as an international finance , trade and shipping center .</seg>
<seg id=964>the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " has proven to have strong vitality after its implementation in real life .</seg>
<seg id=965>today , the re-publication of comrade deng xiaoping 's speech twenty years ago has shown to everyone in the world the strong determination of the central government to implement and adhere to the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " . furthermore , it is also for the purpose of enabling everyone to understand precisely the guidance of " one country , two systems " such as to push ahead the grand implementation of " one country , two systems " .</seg>
<seg id=966>today , the central committee of the cpc and the state council are solemnly convening the state science and technological award convention here .</seg>
<seg id=967>president hu jintao will confer the 2003 state preeminent science and technological award to two academicians , liu dongsheng and wang yongzhi .</seg>
<seg id=968>this convention will also award the national science and technology awards ( top grade ) for " china 's manned space project " , the 2003 national award for natural sciences , national award for technological invention , and national award for science and technology progress to their awardees .</seg>
<seg id=969>on behalf of the central committee of the cpc and the state council , i would like to express enthusiastic congratulations to all awardees .</seg>
<seg id=970>i also wish to extend my sincere regards and esteemed respects to all technology personnel on all front lines across our nation .</seg>
<seg id=971>the first 20 years of this century is an important strategic opportunity period for our nation . we must tightly grasp it and make maximum use of it .</seg>
<seg id=972>we should gather all forces and construct a full - scale fairly prosperous society at a higher level that benefits our population of over 1 billion .</seg>
<seg id=973>we should make best use of this strategic opportunity period and strive for some accomplishments . we must put development of science and technology at a more notable position and attach more importance to it .</seg>
<seg id=974>since the " september 11 " incident , u.s. president bush has introduced the " preemptive strike " policy in june 2002 . the policy was applied in u.s. foreign affairs and the first " preemptive strike " war took place in march last year against iraq .</seg>
<seg id=975>the concept of " preemptive strike " directly contradicts the core principle of " respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other " in international law . moreover , it has the danger that others may copy and follow this principle and thus causing new instability in international order .</seg>
<seg id=976>when the theory of " preemptive strike " first came out , some important political figures in u.s. had already raised this question , " what should we do if other countries gradually follow our way ? "</seg>
<seg id=977>unfortunately just as predicted , more and more countries are saying they would " strike first " in the past two years and the " preemptive strike " team gets bigger and bigger .</seg>
<seg id=978>this is obviously a new trend worthwhile attention and study .</seg>
<seg id=979>in the same month as bush brought out the " strike first " strategy , australian prime minister howard was the first one to stand out and expressed support .</seg>
<seg id=980>he said once australia has obtained reliable information about terrorist attack on the country , it will adopt the " strike first " strategy and is not hesitate to initiate military actions against nearby countries .</seg>
<seg id=981>he even proposes to amend the charter of union nations such that the " strike first " principle can be written in the charter giving nations the right to " strike first " . he thinks this is necessary for the suppression of terrorists or the suppression of countries that support terrorist activities .</seg>
<seg id=982>in northeastern asia , japan defense agency also released a " defense white paper " in july 1999 proposing that japan may attack foreign bases under the " strike first " principle when it faces possible missile attack or on the verge of being invaded militarily .</seg>
<seg id=983>since the iraq war , it is widely reported that japan is stepping up its call for " strike first " strategy .</seg>
<seg id=984>recently , a lot of international public opinions commented on u.s. current policy on africa .</seg>
<seg id=985>an article entitled the " africa policy outlook 2004 " , published in the january 2004 issue of " foreign policy in focus " in u.s. , believe the foreign policy of bush administration has brought forth negative impacts directly and indirectly to africa . u.s. continues to fully focus on the war against terrorism and the problem of proliferation in weapon of mass destruction . in particular , u.s. is tied up in iraq and cannot afford to give too much attention to africa .</seg>
<seg id=986>many of us still recall the bush administration has established the " president 's emergency plan for aids relief " in january last year to express care for africa and undertook to provide a minimum of us $3 billion a year to africa .</seg>
<seg id=987>in july last year , bush visited the five african countries of senegal , south africa , botswana , uganda and nigeria and has promised various assistance to africa , including us $15 billion for the prevention and control of aids , another us $100 million to combat terrorist activities in africa , emergency food relief and education assistance program etc.</seg>
<seg id=988>these assistance programs were once welcomed by african countries and won numerous praises from international community .</seg>
<seg id=989>nevertheless , u.s. has not proceeded with any specific implementation in the past one - year .</seg>
<seg id=990>but , africa is in urgent needs .</seg>
<seg id=991>after we moved into the new century , africa is facing numerous challenges in its development . the " african union " was formed to coordinate the affairs of the whole continent such as to achieve the " development objective for 21st century " devised by united nations in 2000 , which calls for reduction in hunger , poverty and to promote health care and education . the " new partnership for african development " was also laid down to promote development in nations but development capital funds are in serious shortage because of the fragile economic base .</seg>
<seg id=992>the united nations have urged many times for developed countries to use 0.7% of their gross domestic products as official aids to least developed countries .</seg>
<seg id=993>yet , u.s. official aids are only 0.1% of its gross domestic products , which is quite different from the united nations ' request and putting it in the last position on the donor country list .</seg>
<seg id=994>recently , the public opinions in europe are exploring a popular topic -- is the meeting of the " three magnates " , german chancellor schroeder , french president chirac and british prime minister blair , gradually becomes some kind of mechanism ?</seg>
<seg id=995>public opinions called the " three magnates " the " three new carts " of european union and the relation between the three countries as the " new triangle " .</seg>
<seg id=996>the " new triangle " is a new thing and what course it is going to take remains to be seen . however , no matter judging from any angle , the " new triangle " appears to have an overall benefit to the process of uniting europe . hence , it may benefit europe to be a pole in the world 's multi-polarization pattern and also for europe to play a more important role in the international stage .</seg>
<seg id=997>a review of european history for the past hundred years tells us a fundamental characteristic of the triangular relation between germany , france and britain : the alliance of britain and france to restrict or resist germany .</seg>
<seg id=998>the two world wars are the proof .</seg>
<seg id=999>during the cold war , east and west germany were separated as a member in the warsaw pact and the north atlantic treaty organization respectively .</seg>
<seg id=1000>after the cold war , the united germany became much stronger than before and caused an imbalance of power in western europe . france became suspicious and for a certain time , the " germany - france axle " ceased to rotate . this caused france to move closer to britain with an intention to contain germany .</seg>
<seg id=1001>in recent years , the " germany - france axle " has fired up again but the drastic clashes between unilateralism and multi-polarization in the world has pushed european union into a serious spilt on the iraq issue :</seg>
<seg id=1002>the " old europe " led by germany , france and the " new europe " led by britain , poland adopted totally opposite stands in the iraq war problem .</seg>
<seg id=1003>it also happened that the spilt occurred at a time when the european union was about to proceed with the biggest enlargement in history .</seg>
<seg id=1004>egyptian president mubarak made a speech on the issue of reform in arabian countries a few days ago in cairo . he criticized the external world for imposing a single reform model to arabian countries . he warned that such attempt may have an exactly opposite effect and is not beneficial to peace and stability in the middle east region .</seg>
<seg id=1005>he believed reform measures have to be based on distinguishing features in a country and countries should proceed with reforms according to their own capabilities . a single reform model ignores cultural background , social customs and religious characteristic in different countries .</seg>
<seg id=1006>he also pointed out that arabian countries welcome external help in their reform processes . however , such efforts must clearly recognize different national conditions and respect the wishes of different countries before such efforts can effectively push ahead the reform processes in arabian countries encompassing politics , economy and culture etc.</seg>
<seg id=1007>the words of the egyptian leader represent the common view of arabian countries .</seg>
<seg id=1008>at present , middle east is one of the hot spots in the world under the pressure of anti-terrorism , anti-proliferation and democratic reform . it is brewing new unrest and may lead to new integration .</seg>
<seg id=1009>after two wars in afghanistan and iraq , how should political reconstruction be carried out in iraq , the former " axis of evil " to america ?</seg>
<seg id=1010>what will the changes be in the different system of government and the social model in the middle east region ?</seg>
<seg id=1011>this is not only a concern to the arab world and international community . in fact , the united states and its western allies may also be interested in it .</seg>
<seg id=1012>after a meeting with the visiting crown prince salman of bahrain on the 9th in washington , u.s. secretary of state powell reiterated u.s. plan to promote " western democracy and capitalism " in iraq and the middle east .</seg>
<seg id=1013>he further stressed that , " we are contemplating what else can be done and how we can turn all these into systems . "</seg>
<seg id=1014>the international olympics committee designated last year as the " year of education and culture " .</seg>
<seg id=1015>making use of this opportune time , the beijing organizing committee for the games held a series of educational activities to promote advance literacy and popularized the knowledge about the olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=1016>among these activities , the publication of a textbook targeted at young readers , entitled " learn more about the olympic games for high school students " , is an important achievement .</seg>
<seg id=1017>the textbook is excellent in both pictures and literary compositions . it employs the story - telling approach to make lively and systematic introductions about the olympic games and the essence of its spirit . it is a good educational material to strengthen young students ' knowledge about the olympic games and also help raise the enthusiasm of our society to take part in the olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=1018>last year , the beijing organizing committee for the games has also specially designed a timetable for young students , which was made by recycled papers with the beijing olympic logo imprinted on it .</seg>
<seg id=1019>the theme of " green olympics " is to prepare and host the olympic games in accordance with sustainable development concepts , including environmental protection and ecological balance .</seg>
<seg id=1020>just like setting time for lessons , we hope that the timetable can set a standard to the behavior of young students and gradually render them a supporter and promoter of " green olympics " .</seg>
<seg id=1021>education is a core content of the olympic games and an important reflection of the " people 's olympics " .</seg>
<seg id=1022>the real objective of the olympic games is to promote , from a new angle and using a new style of education , the harmonious development of body and mind of young people such as to make a contribution in the construction of a nice and peaceful world .</seg>
<seg id=1023>hence , the combination of sports and education not only opens a new area for education , but also enhance the significance of olympic games in education .</seg>
<seg id=1024>" green olympics " is one of the three themes for the 2008 olympics to be hosted in beijing .</seg>
<seg id=1025>the core content is to greatly improve the quality of the environment in our capital -- create a graceful environment for the olympic games and build an ecological city .</seg>
<seg id=1026>to achieve this end , beijing has to adopt a wide range of technology and measures to protect the environment . it is necessary to promote large - scale environmental treatment in every way , including forestation in city and rural areas ; development of environmental protection industries ; enhance conscious of the society in environmental protection ; and encourage active public participation in different activities to improve the ecological environment .</seg>
<seg id=1027>it is important to do a good job in the implementation of " green olympics " in order to push ahead an all - round , coordinated and sustainable development in beijing 's economy and society . this carries through the assertion in the 16th communist party congress for the establishment of a people - oriented , all - round , coordinated and sustainable scientific development .</seg>
<seg id=1028>we must attach high importance to this .</seg>
<seg id=1029>in order to realize the green olympics objective , the beijing city has already compiled " beijing olympics action plan " and " ecology and pollution control plan " on top of the foundation of its " fifteen plan " and " olympics bid report " . these plans set out the new objectives and plans for environmental development and protection work in the next few years .</seg>
<seg id=1030>through systematic and step - by - step implementation , beijing will accomplish the objective of organizing a green olympics .</seg>
<seg id=1031>on february 25 , u.s. state department released the " 2003 country reports on human rights practices " , which , once again , made frivolous remarks about human right situations in over 190 countries and regions , including china . the tone of the report is just like your " grandfather 's teacher " and says the human right conditions in many countries are no good , in a mess or did not conform to u.s. standard . some other countries are moving backward in crucial areas in human rights etc.</seg>
<seg id=1032>naturally , there are also countries with great improvements in human rights , for example , afghanistan and iraq . however , these are " achievements " of the u.s. army on overthrowing the previous regimes and " liberating " the two countries .</seg>
<seg id=1033>how about the human rights situation in u.s. ?</seg>
<seg id=1034>just like last year , the report has not said one word on that .</seg>
<seg id=1035>on march 1 , the information office of the state council of the people 's republic of china released the " the human rights record of the united states in 2003 " , which complemented the shortcoming of the u.s. human rights report .</seg>
<seg id=1036>the article was based on a large number of facts and introduced the human rights problems in u.s. as well as u.s. violations of human rights in other countries .</seg>
<seg id=1037>in history , the people of america have the tradition of honesty and would not hesitate to admit their mistakes .</seg>
<seg id=1038>the young washington who cut a cherry tree is a lively example that we all know very well .</seg>
<seg id=1039>today , u.s. is the only super power in the world but it does not speak too many honest words any more .</seg>
<seg id=1040>recently , mainstream media in japan have quietly changed their reports on china 's economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1041>contrary to the " china threat " theory before , many reports in japan started to think china 's economic development has pushed ahead japan 's recovery . the vigorous market demand from china is providing significant momentum to japan 's economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1042>u.s. " newsweek " also said in a recent article that the up - rise of china is an opportunity , not a threat , to other countries , especially to neighbor countries .</seg>
<seg id=1043>the once widely circulated " china threat " theory is gradually replaced by the " china opportunity " theory .</seg>
<seg id=1044>the " china threat " theory says china 's development has become a threat to other countries , especially neighbor countries .</seg>
<seg id=1045>but , china 's neighbors did not accept this provoking assertion .</seg>
<seg id=1046>former malaysian prime minister mahathir gave an honest opinion before , " asian countries need not be scared by china 's expanding military and economic power because china never has any tradition to conquer other foreign countries . "</seg>
<seg id=1047>india 's ministry of defense also said in its long - term plan that china has not posed any military threat to india .</seg>
<seg id=1048>in economy and trade , governments and enterprises around the world have taken the chinese market as their best choice for expansion . overseas investors with strategic vision have written the " china opportunity " theory with steady actions : among the top 500 enterprises in our world , more than 400 have invested in china .</seg>
<seg id=1049>for several years , china has been occupying the number one position in the world in terms of amount of foreign capital attracted .</seg>
<seg id=1050>gdp is generally accepted as an important macro economic indicator in our world .</seg>
<seg id=1051>it is of crucial importance that we maintain a growth in gdp throughout the modernization and development process in our nation .</seg>
<seg id=1052>judging simply from the fact that one percent growth in our gdp these days could create corresponding employment for eight hundred thousand people , we have to maintain a fast growth trend in our economy .</seg>
<seg id=1053>to a very great extent , the magnificent objective of building a full - scale fairly prosperous society and the realization of the third strategic framework of modernization rely on a sustained high growth in gdp .</seg>
<seg id=1054>nevertheless , we can visualize the gdp indicator also has many defects .</seg>
<seg id=1055>for example , it does not precisely reflect the quality and structure of the economic growth . it does not reflect the level of social benefits actually enjoyed by people . it also does not measure resources allocation or social justice in our society , etc. etc.</seg>
<seg id=1056>in addition , gdp is also not the only indicator .</seg>
<seg id=1057>when we assess achievements of the governing process , we cannot simply confine ourselves to gdp growth . we need to look at the level of material and culture life actually enjoyed by people . we have to check the unemployment rate in the area , social security , social justice , social order , social administration and social harmony etc. etc.</seg>
<seg id=1058>therefore , we have to use scientific spirit , scientific attitude and scientific thought to deal with the existing computation system for gdp and properly position the gdp indicator within the overall development of our society .</seg>
<seg id=1059>we need to maintain a certain growth rate but not putting too much emphasis on that . we cannot adopt a one - sided view and pursue it painstakingly .</seg>
<seg id=1060>since a delegation of security council visited six nations in western africa last june , the development in the overall situation of the region have been encouraging , despite some complications in specific countries .</seg>
<seg id=1061>we are glad to note that the government of sierra leone has improved the capability of their army and police ; has a better control on its diamond industry ; and has achieved positive progress in organizing local election etc. the united nations mission in sierra leone is also gradually scaling down as planned .</seg>
<seg id=1062>it is even more gratifying to note that liberia is gradually breaking away from the impact of chaos caused by a prolonged war following the deployment of the united nations mission in liberia . the country starts to head for revival and reconstruction .</seg>
<seg id=1063>the political affairs in the republic of guinea bissau have also achieved positive progress and the transitional government undertook to hold election for legislators in march this year .</seg>
<seg id=1064>after some setbacks to the peace process in republic of cote d ' ivoire , a favorable turn has emerged and all related parties agreed to carry out the " linas - marcoussis accord " . the new forces announced its return to the national reconciliation government and the security council is studying the issue of dispatching peacekeeping troops to the country .</seg>
<seg id=1065>we look forward to an early decision by the security council .</seg>
<seg id=1066>the secretariat , the economic community of west african states and the related parties are also striving to solve , on a regional basis , cross - border problems of small arms , mercenaries and use of children as soldiers etc. and have achieved positive fruitful results .</seg>
<seg id=1067>as we approve the aforesaid progress , we should realize the overall situation in western africa is still fragile because of border and historic factors . countries in that region are closely connected and situations often affect each other . the instability in one country may spread to its neighbors or even the whole region .</seg>
<seg id=1068>therefore , as recommended in the security council report , the international community , inclusive of the security council , must adopt an integrated and all - round strategy to solve the western africa problem . a lot of efforts have to be spent to solve cross - border problems and assistance should be extended to related countries , regional and sub-regional organizations like african union and the economic community of west african states etc. in order to improve their ability to prevent and resolve conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1069>we have a common understanding -- children are the future of the world .</seg>
<seg id=1070>we have obligations to create the best and most suitable condition to facilitate their living and learning such that they grow up , become mature and succeed .</seg>
<seg id=1071>however , it is regrettably that there are still thousands and tens of thousands of children injured in armed conflicts in today 's world .</seg>
<seg id=1072>they have gone through turmoil and backwardness . they observed violence and destruction . they were subjected to injury and abuse . they felt sorrow and helpless .</seg>
<seg id=1073>therefore , protection of children from armed conflicts is an important duty of the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1074>every country , especially those involved in conflicts , should strive to do so .</seg>
<seg id=1075>we are glad to see the united nations ( un ) has adopted a series of measure to protect children in armed conflicts and achieved positive results .</seg>
<seg id=1076>the security council has passed a series of four resolutions , including 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) , 1379 ( 2001 ) and 1460 ( 2003 ) , providing an important framework for the protection of children .</seg>
<seg id=1077>in peacekeeping missions undertaken by un in some regions , peacekeepers have taken protection of children as an important part of their job and children protection consultants are often appointed . peacekeeping work has taken into full consideration the special needs of children throughout the process of assisting the country in question to disarm , decommission and return people to society .</seg>
<seg id=1078>some of the peace concord promoted by un or with un participation also contain clauses for the protection of children .</seg>
<seg id=1079>national reconciliation is an important condition for sustained peace and stability in a region after conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1080>when conflict stops , but related parties cannot throw away the past resentment and let bygones be bygones , then the peace situation cannot be strengthened and new conflict could also be ignited again .</seg>
<seg id=1081>in many situations , it needs the joint efforts of all parties involved as well as the assistance and support from international community , especially the united nations , before national reconciliation can be realized .</seg>
<seg id=1082>for many years , united nations played a useful role in assisting the peace process and national reconciliation in many countries after conflicts and has accumulated a lot of experience . in general , we believe united nations should properly deal with the following three areas before it can successfully help countries with conflicts to achieve peace and reconciliation :</seg>
<seg id=1083>it is necessary to give consideration to short term needs and long term targets .</seg>
<seg id=1084>national reconciliation usually has to go through a certain process and cannot be done in one day .</seg>
<seg id=1085>there should be different focal points in different phases .</seg>
<seg id=1086>to promote reconciliation , the first thing is to let warriors say " goodbye to weapons " and create a safe environment .</seg>
<seg id=1087>in this phase , it is important to put forth efforts to remove arms from former military personnel , discharge them and merge them back into the society .</seg>
<seg id=1088>we are glad to see the situation in bosnia and herzegovina is stabilizing day by day . tensions among different nationals continue to alleviate ; reconstruction of economy started to show results ; the work to settle refugees has basically completed ; and the relation with neighboring countries continued to improve .</seg>
<seg id=1089>every one is gratified because the peace process in bosnia and herzegovina is not easily won .</seg>
<seg id=1090>we would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the government and the people of bosnia and herzegovina . we sincerely hope that all parties in bosnia and herzegovina can push ahead the peace process unceasingly and put in more efforts to further improve mutual trust and cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=1091>we also notice at the same time that the capability of institutions at state level in bosnia and herzegovina still needs further improvements , especially in areas like judiciary and police etc. , but the reform is facing some challenges .</seg>
<seg id=1092>we believe it is appropriate for senior - level representatives to take this as a weight - bearing point in their work in the first half of this year . we support the government of bosnia and herzegovina to work positively and in harmony with senior - level representatives .</seg>
<seg id=1093>we believe with the help of international community , the people of bosnia and herzegovina will achieve new developments in their long journey to construct their own country . we wish they could achieve autonomous development at an early date and then , realize the target of joining the unified europe .</seg>
<seg id=1094>the peace and stability in bosnia and herzegovina has an important meaning to the enduring peace and development in that region .</seg>
<seg id=1095>china has followed with interest the development in bosnia and herzegovina all the time and will work together with international community . china will also continue to make its contribution to help bosnia and herzegovina in economic development and realize long - term peace and stability .</seg>
<seg id=1096>china admires the counter - terrorism committee 's efforts to carry out the united nations 1373 ( 2001 ) resolution and its contribution to strengthen the anti-terrorism capability in developing countries . china supports the strengthening of coordination and cooperation between counter - terrorism committee ( the " committee " ) and related international , regional and sub-regional organizations in its fight against international terrorism .</seg>
<seg id=1097>at the same time , we hope the counter - terrorism committee can strive to satisfy the actual demand of developing countries and improve the level of aid in its course of work against terrorism .</seg>
<seg id=1098>at present , the issue of revival of the counter - terrorism committee has aroused the attention of a large number of member nations .</seg>
<seg id=1099>after repeated discussions , the counter - terrorism committee submitted an official report as a document for distribution by the security council .</seg>
<seg id=1100>after the committee was put to work for over two years , the existing structure and operating method of the counter - terrorism committee have clearly showed some shortcomings . for example , the report burden to member countries is too heavy . there were too many meetings and documents . there was insufficient coordination between experts and the results of the committee 's work need improvement .</seg>
<seg id=1101>therefore , we totally support the necessary reform to the counter - terrorism committee . we agree with the basket of solutions recommended in the report , including the set up of an executive committee of the counter - terrorism committee . furthermore , we hope existing problems can be solved properly in the shortest possible time frame , especially the problem of excessive report burden to the vast number of member countries .</seg>
<seg id=1102>in here , i wish to stress that revival and reform is a continuous process . irrespective of the approach to the reform , the counter - terrorism committee should provide policy guidance and direction to the executive committee . any strategic decision must be made in unanimity after discussions in a meeting comprised of the entire counter - terrorism committee .</seg>
<seg id=1103>in recent years , international community is closely monitoring the small arms problem .</seg>
<seg id=1104>this indicates different sides have recognized the over accumulation and illicit trafficking of light weapons endanger the stability , post-war reconstruction and social development in related regions and countries .</seg>
<seg id=1105>it is gratified to note united nations has adopted a series of actions to resolve this problem .</seg>
<seg id=1106>the " firearms - trafficking protocol " annexed to " united nations convention against transnational organized crime " and the united nations " program of action " for small arms and light weapons were reached in 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=1107>these provided a legal and policy basis to properly deal with the small arms problem and signified the determination of international community to combat illicit trades in small arms .</seg>
<seg id=1108>in the past three years , international community has made significant progress in pushing forward the " firearms - trafficking protocol " and the implementation of " program of action " . in 2003 , united nations successfully convened the first biennial meeting on small arms and has provided new momentums to continue a full scale , realistic implementation of " program of action " .</seg>
<seg id=1109>the current session of general assembly passed the 58/241 resolution and decided to set up a work group to discuss an international instrument to identify and trace small arms . this is no doubt another step forward by international community to combat illicit small arms trades .</seg>
<seg id=1110>similarly , the security council is also attaching more importance to the small arms problem and has held several special topic discussions including the adoption of a chairman declaration and resolution .</seg>
<seg id=1111>not only this , the security council has also stressed the importance of dealing with the small arms problem amidst its consideration for a series of problems in the protection of civilians , women and children during conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1112>economic development and elimination of poverty are the fundamental premises to realize sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1113>sustainable economic development is the material foundation for environmental protection and overall progress in our society .</seg>
<seg id=1114>if the question of survival is not solved , development becomes irrelevant and no one can talk about sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1115>endeavor to economic advancement and elimination of poverty is developing countries ' only route to sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1116>if the poverty problem in developing countries is not solved , it will also be difficult for developed countries to continue their development .</seg>
<seg id=1117>sensible usage of resources and protection of environment are inevitable requirements for realization of sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1118>development based on wastage of resources and contamination to environment cannot possibly continue for long .</seg>

<seg id=1517>the majority of the economists at the meeting believed that u.s. officials , including secretary of united states department of treasury john snow , appeared to have abandoned the " strong dollar " policy in recent years .</seg>
<seg id=1518>a weak dollar can provide greater economic development opportunities and creates more jobs , a point most obvious in the manufacturing industry .</seg>
<seg id=1519>at the same time , the devaluation of the u.s. unit renders u.s. products more competitive in domestic and foreign markets , which in turn can help reduce u.s. trade deficit .</seg>
<seg id=1520>however , economists also believed the weak dollar would bring forth negative impacts to u.s.</seg>
<seg id=1521>first , u.s. stock market may continue to track at a low level as the value of different types of investment fall . overseas investors may withdraw their money as they worry about further devaluation of the dollar . second , the cost of imports becomes more expensive , which will eventually lead to erosion of the standard of living in america . third , a massive devaluation might trigger instability in international trade and finance .</seg>
<seg id=1522>in addition , the dollar devaluation also brings forth more serious impact to europe , japan and canada .</seg>

<seg id=1547>the demand for sanctions was filed because united states failed to eradicate the " byrd amendment " within the time limit stipulated by wto .</seg>

<seg id=1564>the proposal is the latest of a series of restrictive immigration measures introduced by the denmark government since rasmussen , leader of liberal party , took up the office as prime minister in november 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=1565>according to reports , the bill is likely to be adopted by parliament because the liberal party has the support of the right wing danish people 's party on the issue of immigrants .</seg>
<seg id=1566>the bill requires children of foreigners born in denmark to present naturalization application when they turn adults , just like any other immigrant . they will not have automatic citizenship .</seg>
<seg id=1567>naturalized immigrants will be stripped of danish citizenship if they commit serious crimes against society .</seg>

<seg id=1575>however , common sense tells us china 's fatal accidents are still far too frequent .</seg>
<seg id=1576>the bulk of these disasters are related to fire , explosion at coalmines , explosion at firecrackers factories and passenger traffic accidents .</seg>
<seg id=1577>this has at least brought out two questions . one , the safety measure in these areas is too weak . two , people have not learned from past tragedies and thus causing similar incidents to take place again and again .</seg>
<seg id=1578>in singapore , there had been a serious fire disaster at one time when the country was enjoying a high economic growth . that bitter experience is still remembered today and it has quickly improved singapore 's safety precaution in public places .</seg>
<seg id=1579>similarly , china is also situated in a very special period of time when it is experiencing a high economic growth and a major transition in the society .</seg>
<seg id=1580>from time to time , we have heard about the accident of a foreign maid fell to death from buildings while working in our country . the ratio of this number is not ridiculously high . nevertheless , given maids are working in a relatively safe environment inside a home , several instances of felling to death are still inconsistent to the low injury rate for this kind of work .</seg>
<seg id=1581>according to statistics , a total of 99 maids of different nationalities fell to death from buildings during january 1999 to june 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=1582>behind these numbers are broken families that can no longer wait for the return of a daughter or a mother . these are misfortunes that could be avoided . hence , it is definitely the direction of our efforts and we must strive to lower the number of such regrets .</seg>
<seg id=1583>according to a public notice released recently by the indonesian embassy , 96 indonesian maids have died since 1999 while working in singapore and some of them were fallen to death from high - rise buildings .</seg>
<seg id=1584>indonesia government has expressed dissatisfaction many times to accidents involving maids fell to death . indonesia government has also imposed new regulations several times to exercise more stringent controls over the quality of maid working here in order to protect the safety of maids . however , the problem is not satisfactorily resolved . as a result , it is inevitably that the maid issue perplexes the singapore - indonesia relation .</seg>
<seg id=1585>it is certainly bewildering that the fell to death number for maids is actually higher than the number of death involving foreigners working in construction sites . therefore , we must consider the issue carefully and investigate deeply into the problem 's background and cause .</seg>
<seg id=1586>mainland china 's world-renowned taiwan expert chen kongli has recently published a new book , entitled " taiwan observation " .</seg>
<seg id=1587>the book included articles mostly written after the first rotation of political party in taiwan up till chen shui - bian 's proposal of " one country on each side " . these are the author 's observation and thoughts about taiwan 's internal situations and cross - strait relation during the period of " listen to what he [ chen ] says and observe his moves " .</seg>
<seg id=1588>articles written two years ago can only be published two years later . this clearly reflects china 's complicated steps in the review and examination of research articles concerning taiwan . the lengthy process further illustrates the " taiwan observation " is difficult to come by .</seg>
<seg id=1589>for a long time , chen kongli 's observation and studies on the taiwan issue have always dealt with concrete matters and he seeks truth from facts independent of and unrestricted by any subjective political framework . he strives to explore into profound knowledge and penetrating insight that stands head and shoulders above all others .</seg>
<seg id=1590>this characteristic is deeply reinforced in my mind after i read with respect his book .</seg>
<seg id=1591>since the early eighties in the last century , the study of the taiwan problem became a " burgeoning field of study " . different scholars and experts had emerged conspicuously from different research institutions and started to demonstrate their talents .</seg>
<seg id=1592>in overseas countries , people have generally classified mainland 's research institutions on the taiwan issue into the north clique and the south clique .</seg>
<seg id=1593>the stance of the north clique is closer to official thinking and their opinions are usually tougher . during certain phases in history and also in important political events , they are more often to show their hostile and exceedingly pressing stand .</seg>
<seg id=1594>in the south clique , their taiwan research institutions are mostly located on the south side of yangzi river , including shanghai and fujian etc.</seg>
<seg id=1595>japanese media revealed that prime minister junichiro koizumi 's " academic record " of " two years study in london " is an exaggeration .</seg>
<seg id=1596>japan 's " shukan post " has verified with the registrar of university of london -- koizumi attended several classes as a non-credit earning student and stayed there for only nine months . he did not receive any academic degree .</seg>
<seg id=1597>this scandal was widely reported and republished by large and small media across china . the news is most gratifying to the vast majority of compatriots .</seg>
<seg id=1598>indeed , even the prime minister of a country has fabricated academic record to cheat the people of his country .</seg>
<seg id=1599>it is especially shameful when it happens in an " imperialism " country like japan .</seg>
<seg id=1600>however , if we can change our angle , we may be able to see some positive meanings from this scandal .</seg>
<seg id=1601>furthermore , these kind of positive things are very often what we lack and are also what we need to perfect urgently .</seg>
<seg id=1602>in recent years , we have been advocating " integrity " and we want to " forge a government - in - sunshine " , improve the " transparency " of government administration , and respect the public 's " right to know " . however , the reality is still very far from ideal .</seg>
<seg id=1603>try and think . the diploma of a country 's prime minister is " fabricated " . after all , it is really not a very big issue but the fact that it can be revealed and pursued by media does indicate something .</seg>
<seg id=1604>in a country like that , is there still anything that cannot be " in - sunshine " ?</seg>
<seg id=1605>in taiwan 's evening election rallies , different camps usually use tourist buses to pick up a large mass of people to the campaign site . however , the recent trend is that evening rallies of bian - lu have become quieter than those of lien - soong .</seg>
<seg id=1606>not long ago , taiwan president chen shui - bian held a campaign rally in a certain northern city . he was shouting " dong suan ( homonym of ' win an election ' ) " but about half of the crowd in front of the stage did not follow him -- it turns out that most of the crowd have friends invested in mainland china but the three direct links are delayed again and again ; the economic policy does not produce results and many feel uncomfortable .</seg>
<seg id=1607>if there is no accident , judging from different signs ranging from public survey to illegal betting over the election result , the defeat of chen - lu pair can be presumed as the presidential election enters the phase of final countdown .</seg>
<seg id=1608>unless there is an outburst of some explosive circumstances , for example , the pan-blue coalition has a major spilt or even more embarrassing scandal , otherwise chen shui - bian , who came to power through secret support of lee teng - hui , has proven incapable of wining enough support from the public over the past four years . in fact , the confidence of pan-green supporters was weakened because the pan-green coalition has continuously exposed their inadequacy in the black gold corruption and a series of no - taste roles or performance .</seg>
<seg id=1609>how should beijing look at the situation where pan-blue coalition may regain power again ?</seg>
<seg id=1610>first , we should understand the pan-blue coalition that may regain power is no longer controlled solely by kuomintang ( nationalist party ) but a combination of kuomintang and the people first party . there will be problems of internal tradition and collaboration with local parties .</seg>
<seg id=1611>the current close cooperation during the election period may not necessarily indicate the relation in future .</seg>
<seg id=1612>if they do win the election , they are going to need a lot of time for internal reorganization in order to face the legislative election following heel at the end of the year . this means it is difficult for the lien - soong regime to make any important changes to the cross - strait relation .</seg>
<seg id=1613>unless they can recognize the improvement of cross - strait relation can help gain some bonus points in taiwan internal politics and are confident that they can create fruitful results in a short period of time . in any event , the most important thing is to be able to let the people of taiwan taste that fruitful result .</seg>
<seg id=1614>given this background , beijing should slow down the unification action and gives the leaders of the " traditional pan-blue coalition " more time to consolidate internal affairs .</seg>
<seg id=1615>it has been more than half of a century since united states ' first nuclear explosion test in new mexico in july 1945 and two atomic bombs were thrown into japan in august the same year .</seg>
<seg id=1616>the arms race between the two super powers of u.s. and russia had caused the accumulation of nuclear weapons to the extent sufficient for the destruction of the entire world . it is fortunate that both sides recognize the destructive power of a nuclear war and had never pressed the nuclear button .</seg>
<seg id=1617>after the disintegration of soviet union , the world moved into a post-cold war period and the danger of a large - scale nuclear war was basically eliminated .</seg>
<seg id=1618>meanwhile , the danger of nuclear proliferation has not decreased but actually increased .</seg>
<seg id=1619>the proliferation has appeared in two areas .</seg>
<seg id=1620>on one hand , certain countries of medium size or above that possess considerable resources and strength have made every effort to produce or acquire nuclear weapons in order to satisfy their objective to dominate a region , to compete with a neighbor country , to maintain security or for extortions in their foreign affairs .</seg>
<seg id=1621>in other cases , certain organizations or groups that are not nations , especially those islamic extremists with strong hatred to western world , are also making every effort to acquire small nuclear weapons in order to carry out bloody terrorist activities against the west and will not hesitate to harm a large group of innocent civilians .</seg>
<seg id=1622>under such demand , brokers for the purchase or sale of nuclear weapons and the transfer of related technology have emerged and the " nuclear black market " was found and flourishing . this has become an important component of nuclear proliferation in our world at this time .</seg>
<seg id=1623>as a descendant of the yellow emperor born and brought up in jiahu , hangzhou , i can still remember the rural scenery and the living of the rural population on the south side of the river in the old days .</seg>
<seg id=1624>i finally return to my hometown after separation for years . along the shanghai - hangzhou freeway , i found many three - storey buildings built by farmers were embellishing here and there in those eye filling green color farmlands . however , i saw only very few people working on the land .</seg>
<seg id=1625>this is really amazing to me . for someone born here but has been sentimentally attached to a foreign country far from home , it is difficult to believe this kind of changes .</seg>
<seg id=1626>recently , i feel unexpected and shocked when i saw some reportage and on - site survey reports about china 's rural villages on the internet .</seg>
<seg id=1627>it is just beyond ordinary imagination that there are still so many dark sides in china 's rural villages . the chinese peasants are still living in poverty , a difficult and humiliating life without rights .</seg>
<seg id=1628>after on - site survey in the three provinces of anhui , henan and hebei , the couple of chen guidi is appealing for farmers and they have compiled a lengthy reportage , entitled " a survey about chinese peasantry " . the report has brought shock waves to the chinese society .</seg>
<seg id=1629>there were numerous instances of farmers being squeezed by corrupted officials or even killed . the conclusion that one can draw : we feel an unprecedented shock and secret anguish when we walk near the chinese farmers . we can see the kind of poverty , crime , helplessness , resistance , silence and sorrow that you can never imagine .</seg>
<seg id=1630>these are words of deep sorrow and extreme grief .</seg>
<seg id=1631>as expected , malaysia prime minister abdullah dissolved parliament the day before yesterday and the election for a new government will be held in the near future .</seg>
<seg id=1632>to abdullah , this election has a great significance to his political career . to malaysia 's political situation and development trend , the result of this election is also of landmark importance .</seg>
<seg id=1633>abdullah took over the leadership from mahathir in november last year , in other words , only four months ago .</seg>
<seg id=1634>notwithstanding that , he still decided to dissolve parliament and advance the date of the poll .</seg>
<seg id=1635>this contains at least two types of meaning : one , abdullah is satisfied with his own political performance in the past four months and has full confidence with intentions of voters ; second , he wishes to use the poll to consolidate his power base such that he can move out from the shadow of mahathir .</seg>
<seg id=1636>without doubt , abdullah 's decision to hold a lightning election reflects that he has already completed a comprehensive assessment of the political situation in malaysia .</seg>
<seg id=1637>the current economic situation in malaysia is quite good and it is not likely that the opposition can use this topic to attack the government .</seg>
<seg id=1638>moreover , abdullah has adopted some high - profile measures against corruption ever since his took over office , including the arrest and prosecution of former lands and cooperative development minister kasitah . these moves have won some favorable views and the public are looking forward optimistically for more actions on anti-corruption .</seg>
<seg id=1639>meanwhile , he has urged to improve the efficiency in civil services , which is another move that inspired people .</seg>
<seg id=1640>since the day european union ( eu ) was formed , it has grown up and shaped under strong influence of french politics and culture .</seg>
<seg id=1641>in foreign affairs , eu strives for independence and autonomy . its stance to world affairs and its approach to issues are different from that of united states . this is the direction of eu 's foreign policy and we can see an obvious shadow of france from it .</seg>
<seg id=1642>because of this , international community , including china , russia and arabian countries , wishes to see a rise of eu such that a totally independent force in international relationship can be seen .</seg>
<seg id=1643>we must admit eu has strived to follow this direction in its foreign policy since the late eighties .</seg>
<seg id=1644>in december 1992 , the heads of eu have agreed unanimously in the maastricht summit that all member countries will carry out a unified foreign policy such that they can say the same words to outsiders .</seg>
<seg id=1645>however , the " unified foreign policy " faced the first complete defeat when eu had to deal with the bosnia problem two years later .</seg>
<seg id=1646>since the maastricht summit ten years ago , we may say that eu 's foreign affairs have nothing good or unusual to report .</seg>
<seg id=1647>more important , eu 's foreign policy cannot go through major tests in important events .</seg>
<seg id=1648>this is proved by the different stands adopted by member countries in the u.s. - iraq war . it once again revealed the fatal defects of eu politics and that is , eu can be easily split up by another big country and be crushed one by one .</seg>
<seg id=1649>bush announced in white house on february 24 that he supports a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage .</seg>
<seg id=1650>this is an obvious change from his ambiguous stance on the issue in the past several months and represents an important political development in a u.s. election year .</seg>
<seg id=1651>this constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage is a very powerful political weapon in southern united states , an emerging stronghold for republicans . however , it also has a great negative effect because it is a heavy weight cultural contention nation - wide that spilt up public opinion . without doubt , the move will accelerate the polarization of u.s. politics and goes a step further from the freedom school of thought that dominates the east and west coast .</seg>
<seg id=1652>in the 2000 election , bush has kept on saying that he supports " unity " and is not a " separatist " but obviously his words and deeds are not in accord .</seg>
<seg id=1653>furthermore , the younger generation in u.s. is adopting an increasingly opened stand on the homosexual issue . bush 's movement may have a short - term effect but could harm the long - term interest of republicans .</seg>
<seg id=1654>bush 's new offensive in form of " constitutional amendment " may be called a " scorched earth strategy " for the presidential election this year .</seg>
<seg id=1655>bush is pursuing this tactic because he is slipping into an increasingly weak position in the " war on terrorism " and the issue of economy - employment . he has no choice but to start a new front line on religion and culture that split domestic opinions .</seg>
<seg id=1656>u.s. is showing a cautious attitude up till now .</seg>
<seg id=1657>that is to say , the maintenance of the current status in taiwan straits can satisfy u.s. long - term objective of having a strategic check and balance on mainland china . therefore , u.s. is trying to avoid political or military conflicts with china because of any encouragement to taiwan independence .</seg>
<seg id=1658>one can easily imagine , u.s. will not comply totally with beijing 's demand and completely eliminate the space for a poll in taiwan . however , based on consideration of its own interests , u.s. may make some warnings in advance .</seg>
<seg id=1659>recently , u.s. secretary of state powell has reiterated the u.s. established taiwan policy on his own initiative and expressly stated u.s. stance against taiwan independence .</seg>
<seg id=1660>outsiders have interpreted the declaration of stands as a signal to chen shui - bien that he should keep things within limits and prevent him from totally possessed by the devil .</seg>
<seg id=1661>some think tanks with governmental background in u.s. have also made some comments recently . u.s. has also sent a large batch of spy ships to the taiwan straits to detect military movements in both sides of the taiwan strait . these actions indirectly indicated u.s. is paying close attention to the status in taiwan strait .</seg>
<seg id=1662>despite u.s. will not comply with beijing 's demand and stop the polls in taiwan , it does indicate from another angle that u.s. is also worrying about the uncertainties in the situation of taiwan strait in this period of time .</seg>
<seg id=1663>any large scale one man , one vote polls , there can only be one type of result -- either chen shui - bien renews his office by luck or lien chan will re-enter taiwan 's presidential palace .</seg>
<seg id=1664>the worrying part is that it appears all circles in the society of mainland are not psychologically ready for a possible victory of chen shui - bien because of the imbalance in information dissemination .</seg>
<seg id=1665>if the poll result is not as desire , it may cause beijing to fall into an unnecessary passive situation again .</seg>
<seg id=1666>an old arab proverb says , " a thousand years of tyranny being better than one day of anarchy " .</seg>
<seg id=1667>is this what is worrying the countries in northeastern asia ?</seg>
<seg id=1668>i think the answer is probably yes .</seg>
<seg id=1669>a famous research and development center closed to washington and funded by u.s. government has recently conducted a study to explore the four possible choices against north korea 's nuclear crisis and they are : relationship , stonewalling , economic sanction and preemptive strike .</seg>
<seg id=1670>the focus of the study is the position adopted by different countries to these strategies .</seg>
<seg id=1671>furthermore , the study also tries to analyze the threat imposed by north korea 's nuclear weapon plan according to people 's fear in neighboring countries , their belief of a probably nuclear attack and the possible damage .</seg>
<seg id=1672>china and russia feel that the danger of north korea using its nuclear weapon is low or very low but the people of japan and south korea believe the threat is rather high .</seg>
<seg id=1673>all northeastern countries in asia are in favor of maintaining a relation with north korea .</seg>
<seg id=1674>japan supports stonewalling and some other countries also accept the strategy of stonewalling under some specific situation .</seg>
<seg id=1675>singapore cares very much about its international ranking and , throughout the year , it keeps on monitoring all kinds of country ranking lists compiled by various u.s. and european institutions .</seg>
<seg id=1676>as we are so often at the top , our interests in these rankings have naturally increased .</seg>
<seg id=1677>however , there is also a lot of trouble for being in the first place in so many areas .</seg>
<seg id=1678>most people in our country feel that if we pay too much attention to rankings , it may indicate our fear of losing . if we emphasize these rankings , it may indicate we are too proud of ourselves .</seg>
<seg id=1679>therefore , people said we should care less for these things and the best thing is to hold oneself aloof from the world .</seg>
<seg id=1680>many people did not care about ranking in the past and hence , an intriguing phenomenon has appeared : people do not take " number one in the world " as good news but are more inclined to take it as an embarrassing issue .</seg>
<seg id=1681>nevertheless , the situation has changed completely in the past one or two years .</seg>
<seg id=1682>we started to have doubts about our country 's long - term competitiveness and people in all trades and profession are worrying about the stability of their jobs .</seg>
<seg id=1683>under such doubts , people are no longer talking that generously .</seg>
<seg id=1684>international competition is fierce . if you do not care enough , other people may overtake you . when you are first in everything , it becomes easy to fall behind in something .</seg>
<seg id=1685>on the face of it , bush has expressed personal loyalty towards cheney . in the republican governors meeting at the end of last month , bush still pledged in all sincerity and seriousness that cheney is the only choice for vice president .</seg>
<seg id=1686>however , he also said in a half joking way that he has already appointed cheney to look for a vice president candidate just like that in 2000 .</seg>
<seg id=1687>the low profile , low key cheney has recently appeared frequently in media interviews and denied that he will be replaced .</seg>
<seg id=1688>however , he also left himself a graceful way to back out .</seg>
<seg id=1689>he said if his health becomes a problem or he feels he is a burden to the president , he could understand the difficulty and withdraw on his own .</seg>
<seg id=1690>cheney is 63 years old and has suffered four heart attacks .</seg>
<seg id=1691>it is widely rumored that u.s. troops has actually tightly surrounded the mastermind of september 11 , osama . u.s. is waiting for the ripe time to make the easy capture .</seg>
<seg id=1692>the presidential election is to be held on november 2 and the pentagon is preparing for a good play to take osama alive in october .</seg>
<seg id=1693>however , a long delay may mean many hitches . there can be no end of trouble in the future if osama slips through by chance .</seg>
<seg id=1694>it looks that giuliani is a safer trump card for bush to win votes .</seg>
<seg id=1695>the contenders for the 2004 u.s. presidential election have been confirmed : democratic candidate kerry challenges the republican president bush .</seg>
<seg id=1696>they have both commenced some " warm - up activities " for the november election including advertising campaign and debates etc.</seg>
<seg id=1697>they will probably argue orally and in writing on the three major issues of war , economy and society .</seg>
<seg id=1698>bush believes war has a close relation to u.s. national security . he has sent soldiers to overthrow saddam , fights terrorism and these are all for u.s. security . that is why he keeps on telling americans , " we are in the middle of a war " .</seg>
<seg id=1699>kerry will naturally point out bush 's wrongdoing of abusing incorrect intelligence on weapons of mass destruction to launch a war against iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1700>on the economic front , kerry thinks bush 's tax cuts benefit the rich but cannot create new jobs .</seg>
<seg id=1701>bush will ask kerry to see : is the economic data in u.s. going up at this time ?</seg>
<seg id=1702>on social problems , if we look at men and women relation , bush opposes same sex marriage , opposes abortion and supports death penalty . kerry also opposes same sex marriage but supports abortion and opposes death penalty .</seg>
<seg id=1703>it is all about how bush and kerry can express their own views on the three major issues and convince voters through advertisement , television and speeches . those are the political shows that the two have to perform in the next 8 months .</seg>
<seg id=1704>however , kerry has more room to show his talent in the area of foreign affairs .</seg>
<seg id=1705>according to statistics , young people who selected to commit suicide are mostly in the age of 15 to 19 , and quite a number of them were actually only 10 - 14 years old .</seg>
<seg id=1706>the general belief is that stress in studies could be a leading factor for children and youth to commit suicide . nevertheless , research discovers that sentimental issues , especially love affairs between male and female , as well as their get along with parents , is the main factor for local youth to commit suicide .</seg>
<seg id=1707>the stress on studies and deviation from expectation are naturally also an area of communication between children and parents .</seg>
<seg id=1708>the stress of moving up to college has been a burden for a long - time to local students during their growth and development period . sometimes , stress is self-imposed but often parents impose the stress to children .</seg>
<seg id=1709>parents demand their children to have good academic results . they frequently compare their children with other children and demand their children to work harder . this will obviously create great stress to children . however , it is really the channel of communication and guidance behind the stress that is the real thermometer for measuring parent and children relation .</seg>
<seg id=1710>if a child is not performing as desired and parents beat or scold the child , use facial expression as a silent reproach or even make the child feel guilty of oneself , this will no doubt push the child to a desperate helpless situation .</seg>
<seg id=1711>it is understood that the spiritual distress of many young students requiring counsel was caused by unrealistic expectation of their parents , which pushes students into dead corners .</seg>
<seg id=1712>due to singapore 's success and rapid development , parents feel their children have much better material conditions than themselves . they naturally believe their children should have better performance than themselves .</seg>
<seg id=1713>parents usually forget their own performance in various areas is not that outstanding when they were kids themselves .</seg>
<seg id=1714>at the age of 1-1/2 , the majority of our children will be sent to childcare centers with full care services . the authority only charges a nominal fee for such service . most children go home only one day in a week or sometimes even one day in a month .</seg>
<seg id=1715>today , singapore is facing the social problem of a low birth rate and an aging society .</seg>
<seg id=1716>the young generation is busy in maintaining their modern living standard and their enjoyment of life - style materialism . they do not even have enough time to take care of themselves . hence , they could not possibly have enough energy to support the government 's call for early marriage and more children .</seg>
<seg id=1717>the author has a bold suggestion : the government should take over all newborn children .</seg>
<seg id=1718>citizens of our nation only need to think about giving birth to children but not raising them .</seg>
<seg id=1719>on one hand , the government can operate childcare centers and kindergartens of full care style . primary schools can be converted to a full - day system and may even include service for three meals . the government will only charge a nominal fee affordable to our citizens .</seg>
<seg id=1720>this will create jobs for the unemployed in our population and the government need not worry about the effectiveness of different measures like child bonus , increase in duration of maternity leave , the quality of maids and tax rebates etc.</seg>
<seg id=1721>what beijing needs to do is not only to play a leading role in the six - party talks but also keeps in mind china 's long - term interest in the korean peninsula . it is always better to repair the house before it rains and so , beijing should unfold its strategic deployment as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=1722>in specific terms , on one hand , beijing has to urge north korea to abandon its nuclear weapon . on the other hand , it has to induce a reform on kim jong - il regime and guides north korea to the road of modern civilization . this removes the danger of a nuclear war in northeastern asia and could also become chips for long - term strategic dealings with u.s.</seg>
<seg id=1723>pyongyang is fierce of mien but faint of heart . deep inside pyongyang 's mind , it is longing for economic development and the opportunity to blend into international community .</seg>
<seg id=1724>it is only that its wishes are frequently expressed in external forms that are valiant , irrational and sometimes totally against international rules .</seg>
<seg id=1725>in fact for quite some time , beijing has been using its influences and economic aid measures to force pyongyang to change its stand of not complying with international rules .</seg>
<seg id=1726>this kind of action obviously needs an all - round planning .</seg>
<seg id=1727>beijing 's assistance to pyongyang should not be limited to the economic layer but can be extended to other areas in the society . beijing should not limit itself to persuade pyongyang to abandon its nuclear plan but also guide pyongyang to the route of modern civilization .</seg>
<seg id=1728>when john kelly first entered the arena , nobody is betting on him . at that time , all focuses were on former vermont governor dean .</seg>
<seg id=1729>however , kelly has sudden emerged as a new force before the iowa caucus in january . he won the primary or caucus in two most critical states in one blow -- iowa and new hampshire .</seg>
<seg id=1730>basically , kelly has not missed in any primaries in other states afterwards . for those states that he missed , it was because those states already had their own candidates .</seg>
<seg id=1731>kelly has only used six weeks and turned from a candidate with almost no future to the final candidate . all of his competitors including gephardt , lieberman , clark , dean and edwards have fallen out one by one . people cannot help but to treat kelly 's political charisma with increased respect .</seg>
<seg id=1732>throughout his 19 years career as a senator , kelly supports abortion and environmental protection . he opposes tax cuts that benefits the rich and strives to raise the minimum wage . he also hopes to solve the global warming issue .</seg>
<seg id=1733>his working experience in washington shows that he is willing to face difficult problems in the society , bold enough to challenge authoritativeness , thorough pursuance of value and is not afraid of offending the interests of a small group of people .</seg>
<seg id=1734>china 's reform and opening policy started from agriculture and rural residents are the early beneficiaries of this policy .</seg>
<seg id=1735>however , the economic policy has leaned greatly towards cities since the nineties and the reform in agriculture has come to a stand still . the gap between city and rural areas has widened .</seg>
<seg id=1736>as time progress , there are two different worlds in china . on one hand , we have the highly prosperous cities and on the other hand , the rural villages are backward and in poverty .</seg>
<seg id=1737>using the words of chinese officials , the widening gap between rich cities and poor villages is a " problem during the course of development " . it has to be solved through sustained development .</seg>
<seg id=1738>in other words , china 's coastal regions and cities should continue with development and need not be dragged down by the problem in rural villages .</seg>
<seg id=1739>however , when people see that cities can have a small change in one year and a major change in three years , they cannot help but ask : why is there no change at all in some poor regions over the past several decades ?</seg>
<seg id=1740>of course , the development path for cities and rural villages is quite different . this is a fact that we have to admit . but , the problem is that we have put a large amount of capital into city development . we encourage and support the rich middle class . at the same time , does the rural population , which accounts for 70% of the nation 's population , receive the care and importance they deserve ?</seg>
<seg id=1741>in theory , we cannot say the past administrations of the chinese government did not attach importance to agriculture , rural villages and farmers .</seg>
<seg id=1742>however , the situation in rural villages has turn worst and becomes increasingly difficult in recent years . this has illustrated the degree of importance attached is clear not enough .</seg>
<seg id=1743>public security , procuratorate and judiciary should be images of fair and justice in any country and is also the most important system to protect social stability .</seg>
<seg id=1744>unfortunately , public security , procuratorate and judiciary have become images of corruption in china .</seg>
<seg id=1745>according to the report by china 's national audit office , the result of an examination on financial expenditures in public security institutions in 26 province / city showed that spending against regulation amounted to rmb 16.5 billion across the nation .</seg>
<seg id=1746>the result makes it open that the distrust in public security , procuratorate and judiciary has reached a crisis state .</seg>
<seg id=1747>the liu yong case , the sun zhigang case and the latest " bmw " case in heilong jiang have all reflected the profound distrust .</seg>
<seg id=1748>the " bmw " incident is a typical case .</seg>
<seg id=1749>the close attention to the case has far exceeded the attention to " sars " during the " sars " crisis period because people are so much concerned about the issue .</seg>
<seg id=1750>in fact , people are not caring about the " bmw " incident itself . people are expressing their distrust to the whole judiciary system .</seg>
<seg id=1751>the related departments understand this clearly and they have taken measures to shut up the media soon afterwards .</seg>
<seg id=1752>however , the problem is still there .</seg>
<seg id=1753>the second round six - party talks on korean peninsula nuclear issue has ended in a way as many have expected .</seg>
<seg id=1754>in this meeting , the related parties have made contacts and probes on surrounding issues to the korean peninsula nuclear crisis . they have also reached the common consensus to set up a working group before the third round of talks , which is to be held before the end of june this year .</seg>
<seg id=1755>however , there was no progress at all in the meeting as to how north korea would abandon its nuclear weapon research program , or how united states would guarantee north korea 's political and military safety after it abandoned the nuclear program , or other practical issue like energy aid etc. in fact , it only gives people the impression that the " deadlock " has been tightened further .</seg>
<seg id=1756>the two important figures -- north korea and united states have not made any concession and the fundamental position of the both sides have not changed a bit .</seg>
<seg id=1757>nevertheless , the conspicuous point is that u.s. does not show any desire for a fast resolution of the problem in this meeting but rather gives people the impression of " dragging " on .</seg>
<seg id=1758>this kind of u.s. policy is obviously related to the latest development in international situations and the benefits that u.s. attempts to gain from these latest developments .</seg>
<seg id=1759>there have never been so many bosses of corporations thrown into jail in america ever since the time when roosevelt was president .</seg>
<seg id=1760>is this a coincidence or is that the public and investors can no longer tolerate illegal and criminal corporate activities in the last three years and thus , causing these crimes be revealed recently one after the other ?</seg>
<seg id=1761>there is no simple answer to that . however , it is a fact that many illegal corporate activities were revealed recently .</seg>
<seg id=1762>this is good for economic recovery and especially a good sign in the restoration of investor confidence .</seg>
<seg id=1763>the end of the nineties may be the most disorderly period in the history of u.s. commerce and also the most difficult phase to understand . hence , the earlier its impact is gone , the better .</seg>
<seg id=1764>once the dust settles , some corporate names may vanish from history and could only be found in college textbooks in commerce .</seg>
<seg id=1765>new management teams are leading some other companies , for example , tyco and mci , and they are trying their best to reposition themselves to meet the challenges in a new round of economic growth .</seg>
<seg id=1766>but , when will a new round of economic growth arrive ?</seg>
<seg id=1767>as a ceo , you may not have the answer .</seg>
<seg id=1768>this is not important though , because even the chairman of u.s. federal reserve alan greenspan does not know the answer .</seg>
<seg id=1769>the bush administration is trying to use keynes philosophy to stimulate the economy , which calls for massive increase in spending ( especially in defense spending ) on one hand and massive tax cuts on the other hand .</seg>
<seg id=1770>in international affairs , the bush administration continues to promote free trade but trade deficits have already reached a new high of us $549 billion .</seg>
<seg id=1771>after the massive tax cuts , investments and consumption did not show any remarkable growth .</seg>
<seg id=1772>the new keynes school of thought represented by famous british economist , wyme godley , believe u.s. economy is mired in difficulties and bush 's fiscal and economic strategy is unable to save the situation .</seg>
<seg id=1773>they believe the so - called " market discipline to command " is only an illusion which inevitably benefits a few while putting the vast majority into an unfavorable situation .</seg>
<seg id=1774>in the past , most people believe the benefited in our world are a few in u.s. while those in an unfavorable situation are the vast number in developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=1775>nowadays , that is not the fact .</seg>
<seg id=1776>apart from those multinational companies based in u.s. , many u.s. economists believe that india and china are the notable winners in the current globalization process .</seg>
<seg id=1777>india dominates the service economy sector while china dominates the manufacturing area .</seg>
<seg id=1778>while people concentrate their attention on the phenomenon of massive shift in u.s. capital and production equipment to china , they fail to see the advantage of a high quality , low - income labor market in china .</seg>
<seg id=1779>first , is the current situation in taiwan within or outside the expectation of beijing ?</seg>
<seg id=1780>obviously , beijing 's expectation is only known to beijing itself . however , other people can deliberate beijing 's assessment results using other public information .</seg>
<seg id=1781>in the past four years , the camp led by chen shui - bian and lu hsiu - lien has been actively promoting taiwan independence using clear - cut language and ruthless efforts .</seg>
<seg id=1782>to the contrary , beijing has only made occasional protests but , other than that , its response became quite a routine procedure and appeared indifferent to the progress of taiwan independence .</seg>
<seg id=1783>since autumn last year , the situation suddenly changed completely . it appears as if a cow cart has suddenly turned into a motorcar . over the past few months , its handling capability is obviously different from that in the nineties .</seg>
<seg id=1784>based on this , we can speculate the current situation in taiwan is within beijing 's expectation .</seg>
<seg id=1785>second , we can look at foreign affairs involving taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=1786>regarding the situation in taiwan strait , we need to see whether the position of major countries , for example , united states etc. is closer to beijing or closer to taipei .</seg>
<seg id=1787>the stands of these countries are opened and clear . therefore , the answer is obvious .</seg>
<seg id=1788>up till now , these countries are getting closer to beijing and have more specific associations . on the other hand , these countries are getting further away from taipei and specific associations are fewer than before . furthermore , some " sincere words and earnest wishes " started to appear to the much - praised democracy in taiwan .</seg>

<seg id=1>after entering the new century , economic globalization has become a great and grim challenge facing african countries .</seg>
<seg id=2>african leaders have come to realize more and more clearly that africa can no longer afford to lose good opportunities and should seek ways to deal with the issue .</seg>
<seg id=3>on july 9 , 2002 , the african union officially began its operation . since then , african countries , on one hand , have been actively promoting the " new partnership for african development program " in an effort to develop the economy and change their unfavorable position in the economic globalization process ; on the other hand , they have made great efforts to remove major barrier to africa 's great rejuvenation course -- armed conflicts -- to create a unified , peaceful and stable environment .</seg>
<seg id=4>currently , africa 's overall situation has seen a trend of easing up , with hot issues obviously cooling down . all the countries have strengthened their sense of urgency to end armed conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=5>with the full support of the un and the international community , africa 's influential regional organizations , big powers and famous politicians have all taken actions to aggrandize their efforts to settle regional conflicts and eliminate internal chaos . some long lasting conflicts and chaos have almost been brought under control .</seg>
<seg id=6>for example , a national unity government was formed in congo ( kinshasa ) last june ; sao tome and principe settled a coup crisis through peaceful ways in july ; liberian government and rebels reached peace agreement in the ghanaian capital of accra in august ; sudanese government and southern rebels started key negotiations to break the impasse in peace process in september ; somali 's various militia and political parties began peace talks in kenya to discuss the national peace process in october ; burundian government and rebels signed a peace agreement in november .</seg>
<seg id=7>of course , africa 's current stable situation is still fragile and the fruit of peace needs to be consolidated while there are still some potential or current armed conflicts that need to be settled once and for all .</seg>
<seg id=8>in the meantime , the speed of african countries ' economic development still lags far behind other developing countries in asia and other regions . this is an unfavorable factor for africa 's development .</seg>
<seg id=9>the african people need to make long - term and arduous efforts to find ways to effectively deal with the challenges posed by the economic globalization and realize the dream of african rejuvenation .</seg>

<seg id=114>washington authorities strengthened inspections of foreign tourists when worries about flight security were sharply increasing recently . over the past week , such worries have led to the temporary cancellation of several flights from and to the united states .</seg>

<seg id=472>snowfall covers north - west europe , causing big traffic chaos</seg>
<seg id=473>( afp report from paris , january 29 ) snowstorms have covered most parts of western and northern europe , causing big chaos in road and railway traffic and leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights in britain , germany and denmark .</seg>
<seg id=474>in london , a spokesman at the heathrow airport said that the snowfall last night had forced the cancellation of over 200 flights at the airport with 80 more flights cancelled this morning .</seg>
<seg id=475>the two other airports near london , the gatwick and the stansted airports , were also affected by the snowfall with a total of 18 flights cancelled due to the weather condition .</seg>
<seg id=476>in germany , the wintry weather has led to the cancellation of at least 60 flights bound for the frankfurt international airport , which is the largest airport in germany .</seg>
<seg id=477>transportation authority said that the remaining dozens of flights bound for frankfurt had been delayed and the air traffic could be affected by the weather condition for a whole day .</seg>
<seg id=478>in france , following the snowfall last night , a traffic blockade was imposed in paris but similar measures were lifted in the morning in other parts of france .</seg>
<seg id=479>all the services in paris ' major airports have been back normal . yesterday 's heavy snow and fog delayed flights in the de gaulles airport .</seg>
<seg id=480>however , airport authorities in paris have suggested that air travelers should confirm if their flights were on time before starting their journeys .</seg>
<seg id=481>except for the mediterranean shore , most parts of france have been covered in white snow .</seg>
<seg id=482>both taiwan and japan are democratic countries and have the obligations and responsibilities to make concerted efforts to consolidate democracy in asia .</seg>
<seg id=483>to promote the democratic value , our government will establish the " taiwan democratic fund " in the near future , with international party cooperation one of its major tasks .</seg>
<seg id=484>the democratic progressive party expects to join hands with democratic parties in other countries through this way to share the experiences of democratic development with other countries in an effort to contribute to asia 's peace , stability and prosperity and to realize the aspirations of the " asian democratic alliance " in an early date .</seg>
<seg id=485>at present when the international situation is fast changing , the rise and decline of regional forces concern the overall situation , with all countries ' securities being tested .</seg>
<seg id=486>in terms of the asian pacific region , since the united states launched the war against iraq , north korea , which is armed with nuclear weapons , has tested its missiles several times to fly over japan 's territorial air space ; in addition , china has long been actively building up its military strength and has deployed missiles targeting at taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=487>all these have posed a serious threat to the securities of taiwan and japan as well as the asian pacific region .</seg>
<seg id=488>these topics relating to democracy build - up and safeguarding the security can only be discussed and settled through a formal security mechanism .</seg>
<seg id=489>today 's meeting is the first dialogue on the security issues between parliamentarians from taiwan 's ruling democratic progressive party and japan 's ruling liberal democratic party as well as other parties . its significance is very clear .</seg>
<seg id=490>i also hope that apart from taiwan and japan 's bilateral talks , asian pacific countries including the us , japan and south korea can cooperate to push forward the establishment of a " security dialogue mechanism " and support taiwan 's participation in the region 's multilateral dialogue organizations to implement the spirit of " cooperative security " .</seg>
<seg id=491>today is an important moment to encourage us to keep moving forward on the road of reform . we greatly affirm the fact that all the party comrades are able to show the party 's will to make joint efforts to reach the reform objectives .</seg>
<seg id=492>" the withdrawal of parties from the media organizations of radio and tv " is the basic requirement in implementing media reform and it is also the firm will of the democratic progressive party . ruling will only speed up the reform process instead of becoming a hindrance or a burden .</seg>
<seg id=493>we also know that to achieve the objectives , it is a small but a key step in media reforms for party comrades , who hold public service posts , to take the lead in withdrawing from media operations .</seg>
<seg id=494>in the past when there were curfews and a media monopoly , in an effort to create more open public opinions , many party comrades had devoted themselves to the arduous task of setting up the fourth station and local radios in a bid to break the then restrictions and inject more momentum for reforming the media environment through this way .</seg>
<seg id=495>for example , comrade cai tong - rong had devoted much effort for the establishment of the fourth tv station , thus giving birth to the " people 's tv " .</seg>
<seg id=496>the move exerted great influence on the whole media environment . it , in particular , broke the long - term monopoly by the three stations and created more space for the development of cable tv stations .</seg>
<seg id=497>however , we must understand that due to limitations of the historical environment , many practices were taken because they could not be otherwise in order to push forward the reforms . so , today when the media environment is totally open and free , the mission of the last stage has been fulfilled . to push forward the reform process , it is a must for us to determine what to keep and what to give up .</seg>
<seg id=498>the central standing committee has announced that all the party comrades , who hold public service posts , should withdraw from the media operations when the legislative council begins its next session on september 5 to set an example of keeping the promise for the people .</seg>
<seg id=499>we are very gratified that all members are able to keep in mind the party 's aspirations and objectives , including those comrades who contributed a lot during the democratic movement , such as cai tong - rong , zhang jun - hong , zhou qing - yu , hou shui - sheng , gao meng - ding , huang nai - hui and shen ming - gong . they are all able to give up their own interests and attach more importance to promoting media reforms .</seg>
<seg id=500>ruling does not mean to enjoy power but to shoulder more responsibility .</seg>
<seg id=501>despite of the frustrations or ups and down during the administration of the democratic progressive party , we have always been able to convert challenges into a driving force to move forward and stably lead taiwan to establish the structures for deepening its democracy in line with the world 's common values of democracy , peace and prosperity .</seg>
<seg id=502>because we have long been holding that people are the masters of the country , the democratic progressive party 's responsibility is hence to sublime its founding spirit of " honest and upright , diligent administration , loving homeland " to a brighter vision of " reform , progress and good life " , and to lay a foundation for the long - term peace and stability of the 23 million taiwan people .</seg>
<seg id=503>for a long period of time , the democratic progressive party has been playing a role of " shadow government " in expanding taiwan 's diplomatic efforts and has achieved excellent results .</seg>
<seg id=504>despite of chinese communist party 's constant obstructions , we have never retreated because the fate is in our own hands . though there are no sufficient resources , the democratic progressive party has , step by step , expanded taiwan 's international participation space .</seg>
<seg id=505>" multilateral diplomacy " has been the core of democratic progressive party 's overall diplomatic strategy . over the past year , based on the platform of the " asian free democratic alliance " , we have successfully shared experiences and conducted party exchanges with countries in the region regarding such topics as economic challenges in the east asian region , democratic reforms of parties , elimination of money politics , settlement of globalization and poverty issues , political publicity and communication as well as the youth 's participation in politics .</seg>
<seg id=506>i will assume the post of chairman of " asian free democratic alliance " next march . i expect to use the capacity as a leader of an international organization to create more opportunities for taiwan to contribute to the international community .</seg>
<seg id=507>in addition , since the democratic progressive party became a formal member of " the international free alliance " last year , it has been actively engaged in relevant affairs of the organization .</seg>
<seg id=508>apart from the fact that it has designated a human right commissioner in the headquarters ' secretariat in london , it will cooperate with other member parties in holding relevant seminars on political reforms in central and south america and in europe .</seg>
<seg id=509>on september 28 , our party celebrated its 17th birthday .</seg>
<seg id=510>the 17 - year - old democratic progressive party has long been holding the democratic aspiration and is full of vitality in reforms and progress .</seg>
<seg id=511>because we have long been siding with the democratic reform , we have been able to win taiwan people 's trust . it is also because of this , we will assume more solemn and greater responsibilities and missions in the future .</seg>
<seg id=512>when we took office as a ruling party three years ago , the previous ruling party had indirectly amended the constitution six times in the 1990s .</seg>
<seg id=513>from the parliament 's overall re-election in 1991 , the direct presidential election in 1994 , the freeze of provincial government 's organizations in 1997 to the non-standing of the national assembly in 2000 , the winding course of amending the constitution is in fact a road taken by the taiwan people to consolidate sovereignty and the legitimacy of democracy .</seg>
<seg id=514>if we saw the direct presidential election in 1996 as the most important symbol of taiwan becoming a sovereign democratic country , then the " integrated " state will be ten years old in 2006 .</seg>
<seg id=515>following ten years of practice , we must think about what we shall pursue next as a democratic state with independent sovereignty .</seg>
<seg id=516>i must say that we should further push forward the democracy drive and seek a more efficient constitutional system in order to lead the taiwan people to take on grim challenges in the new century .</seg>
<seg id=517>asia is the world 's largest continent , covering nearly 30% of the globe 's land , with its population currently accounting for 60% of and overall economic volume 1/4 of the world 's total . it should and is able to make outstanding contributions to the world 's peace and development .</seg>
<seg id=518>asia has splendid cultures with a long history . the yellow river and yangtze river valleys , the indian river and the ganga river valleys as well as the tigris and euphrates river valleys are famous birthplaces of human civilizations .</seg>
<seg id=519>during the long course of history , the asian people have written a brilliant page in the development of human civilizations .</seg>
<seg id=520>since the modern times , asia has experienced many vicissitudes and suffered a lot of hardships . the peoples of various countries have made unremitting efforts in seeking emancipation and development and made great achievements .</seg>
<seg id=521>however , asia has a long way to go before realizing its re-emergence and rejuvenation .</seg>
<seg id=522>strengthening cooperation , promoting development and attaining common wins is the only way for asia to realize its re-emergence and rejuvenation and is also in the basic interests of the asian people .</seg>
<seg id=523>under the new circumstances in the new century , asia 's development faces new opportunities .</seg>
<seg id=524>peace and development remain the theme of the present era . the overall peaceful international environment has offered favorable external conditions for asia 's development .</seg>
<seg id=525>the deepening of economic globalization , the fast advancing of the world 's scientific and technological revolution , the optimizing and restructuring of key production factors internationally and the speeding up of industrial transformation are all helpful to asian countries in making use of international capital , introducing advanced technologies , tapping the world markets and accelerating their economic development .</seg>
<seg id=526>with abundant natural resources and a huge market , asia is a region with strongest economic vitality in today 's world and has great development potential .</seg>
<seg id=527>a huge population and underdevelopment are china 's two national conditions .</seg>
<seg id=528>china has a population of 1.3 billion . no matter how small a problem is , if it times 1.3 billion , it will become a very big problem ; no matter how significant the financial and material resources are , if divided by 1.3 billion , it will be at a very low per capita level .</seg>
<seg id=529>this is what the chinese leaders must keep in mind at any time .</seg>
<seg id=530>to deal with the problems of its 1.3 billion people , china can depend on no one but itself .</seg>
<seg id=531>since the founding of the people 's republic of china , we have achieved a lot in construction but have taken some tortuous paths and lost some opportunities at the same time .</seg>
<seg id=532>since the reform and opening up in 1978 , we have finally found a right path to develop ourselves .</seg>
<seg id=533>this is : the chinese people will independently build socialism with chinese characteristics .</seg>
<seg id=534>the pith of the road is to motivate all positive factors to emancipate and develop the productive forces , and respect and safeguard the chinese people 's freedom in pursuit for well - being .</seg>
<seg id=535>china 's reform and opening up moved from rural to urban areas and from economic sectors to political , cultural and social sectors .</seg>
<seg id=536>all in all , its every further step is to free the vigor of all labor , knowledge , technology , management and capital , and let all resources fully play their role in creating social wealth .</seg>
<seg id=537>over the past few years , profound changes have been taking place across the world . science and technology change with each passing day , the level of the world productive forces keeps rising , and the world markets are getting tied closer , offering historic opportunities for the development of all countries .</seg>
<seg id=538>however , it should be noted that the issues such as power politics , regional conflicts , terrorism , epidemic diseases and environment deterioration are still posing threats to the world 's stability and development .</seg>
<seg id=539>the negative influence of economic globalization has increased the risks and costs of economic and social development of the developing countries . some developing countries even face the danger of being marginalized .</seg>
<seg id=540>currently , although the world economy is gradually recovering , it still faces many uncertain factors .</seg>
<seg id=541>complicated factors such as the setback of the doha multilateral trade talks and trade protectionism have brought more difficulties to developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=542>it is a relief that many developing countries are actively forging ahead , dedicated to reforms and making themselves prosperous , and have made outstanding achievement .</seg>
<seg id=543>in the international arena , the developing countries , backed by organizations like the non-aligned movement and group of 77 , have strengthened their unity and cooperation and contributed a lot to safeguarding their legitimate rights and seeking a change of the irrational international political and economic order , and have become a major force in pushing forward the democratization of the international relations .</seg>
<seg id=544>meanwhile , exchanges and cooperation among developing countries are also fruitful , with more frequent economic exchanges taking place .</seg>
<seg id=545>from the andes mountains to the mekong river , from the establishment of the union of maghreb to the founding of the african union , the content and form as well as the mechanism and measures of the south - south cooperation are continuously being enriched , perfected and updated .</seg>
<seg id=546>the past year was also a year that has seen a continuous and full development of sino - canadian friendly and cooperative ties .</seg>
<seg id=547>the two nations ' trade maintained a rising momentum , with the total trade volume reaching nearly $10 billion .</seg>
<seg id=548>there has been frequent high - level exchange of visits . a number of prominent canadian political figures visited china respectively , including defense minister , environmental minister and international cooperation minister . chinese high - ranking officials including president of the chinese supreme court and minister of commerce also visited canada respectively . more importantly , the prime ministers of the two counties have successfully exchanged visits .</seg>
<seg id=549>premier wen jiabao 's recent visit to canada is significant in carrying forward the course and forging ahead into the future , and has injected new momentum to the further development of sino - canadian relations and laid a solid foundation for pushing forward the two countries ' friendly cooperation in all fields to develop more extensively and deeply .</seg>
<seg id=550>china and canada will continue to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the areas of politics , economy , culture and education as well as science and technology and will make great efforts to realize the objective of doubling bilateral trade volume by 2010 .</seg>
<seg id=551>fellow countrymen and friends :</seg>
<seg id=552>although you are living overseas , your heart has always been connected with the homeland . you have followed the motherland 's construction and development and have shared the worries and happiness of people in the motherland at each critical moment , with your pulse beating with the motherland .</seg>
<seg id=553>last year , when sars and floods hit some parts of china , you expressed your deep concern and best wishes to the people in the motherland through internet , letters , phone calls and donations . the overseas chinese people from all walks of life have held a series of large - scale donation activities and benefit performances . after the successful flight of the " shenzhou - v " manned spacecraft , your telegraphs , letters and cards of congratulations flooded in , expressing your happiness and pride about the achievements made by china 's space science and technology .</seg>
<seg id=554>during premier wen jiabao 's visit , hundreds of compatriots and overseas students welcomed premier wen at the airport in spite of the chilly winds , which was a very touching scene .</seg>
<seg id=555>here , i 'd like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to you all . i believe in the new year you will continue to make more and greater contributions to china 's prosperity , the development of sino - canadian ties , china 's complete unification and its all - round rejuvenation .</seg>
<seg id=556>firstly , to strengthen mutual political trust and deepen strategic cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=557>china and france are both permanent members of the un security council and are countries that exert important influences on international affairs .</seg>
<seg id=558>both of our two countries support the acceleration of the world 's multipolarization , hold that the un 's authority should be safeguarded , and are willing to establish a new international political and economic order which conforms to the wills of all peoples .</seg>
<seg id=559>both of us share extensive common ground and interests in dealing with various challenges facing the mankind and properly settling major international affairs .</seg>
<seg id=560>we are willing to strengthen dialogues and discussions with france on major issues such as fighting against terrorism , anti-proliferation , cracking down on cross - border crimes , pushing forward common development and strengthening un 's role .</seg>
<seg id=561>secondly , to strengthen economic and trade cooperation to realize mutual benefits and complementation .</seg>
<seg id=562>china is the world 's largest developing country , which is fully engaged in the modernization construction and has a huge market .</seg>
<seg id=563>france is a developed country and ranks among the world 's best in terms of economic and science and technology development , with leading technologies in many fields .</seg>
<seg id=564>the economies of our two countries are very mutual complementary , with a great potential for economic and trade cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=565>since the founding of new china , the chinese government has been paying great attention to developing its ties with africa and has adopted a series of guidelines and policies .</seg>
<seg id=566>we have been firmly holding the five principles of peaceful co-existence , respecting african countries in independently choosing their political systems and development roads , offering assistance to african countries within our ability , carrying out economic and technological cooperation , supporting african nations ' unity and cooperation , pushing the international community to pay attention to africa 's peace and development , supporting african countries to participate in international affairs on an equal footing , and strengthening sino - african talks and cooperation to safeguard the rights of developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=567>sino - african relations have a long history and are deeply rooted in people 's heart .</seg>
<seg id=568>since the founding of new china , we have long been firmly supporting africa 's national liberation course and has sincerely offered assistance to help african nations develop their national economies .</seg>
<seg id=569>chinese experts , doctors , teachers and workers dispatched to africa have been working with the local people and living with them friendly like brothers .</seg>
<seg id=570>in international affairs , china and african countries have showed mutual understanding of and support and have become partners with mutual trust .</seg>
<seg id=571>the chinese people will never forget it was due to the full support of most developing countries including african nations that china 's legitimate right in the un was resumed at the 26th un assembly in 1971 .</seg>
<seg id=572>over the past few years , sino - african political mutual trust at various levels and between different personnel has been deepening . economic and trade cooperation are fruitful and friendly exchanges in fields of culture and education , healthcare , science and technology and sports have robustly developed . the sino - african cooperation forum set up at the turn of the new century has established a new platform for the development of sino - african relations and deepening cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=573>china and africa have established a long - term and stable new partnership based on equality and mutual benefits . the sino - african friendly and cooperative ties have entered a new stage of full development .</seg>
<seg id=574>seven years after nixon visited china and the announcement of the sino - american shanghai communiqu , the carter administration accepted the chinese stance on the taiwan issue and realized the establishment of sino - american diplomatic ties .</seg>
<seg id=575>this incident and deng xiaoping 's successful visit to the united states opened a new chapter in sino - american relations .</seg>
<seg id=576>during early stages of the regan administration , china and the us had severe conflicts over the taiwan issue .</seg>
<seg id=577>following arduous negotiations , the two governments issued the renowned 8.17 communiqu in 1982 , reaching agreement on phasing down the weapon sales to taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=578>the shanghai communiqu , the sino - american communiqu on establishing diplomatic relations and the 8.17 communiqu serve as the political cornerstones of sino - american ties .</seg>
<seg id=579>during the 10 years after the establishment of diplomatic ties , in spite of the two countries ' occasional conflicts over the taiwan issue , sino - american ties remained stable in general and exchanges and cooperation in all fields saw a gradual increase .</seg>
<seg id=580>in the 1980s and the beginning of 1990s in the 20th century , the cold war came to an end as east europe experienced dramatic changes and the soviet union dissolved . the international situation underwent the most profound changes since the second world war .</seg>
<seg id=581>the united states took the lead in imposing sanctions on china and announced to sell 150 f - 16 fighter jets to taiwan . it linked the human rights issue with the most favored nation treatment and allowed lee teng - hui to visit the us , which brought sino - american relations to the all - time low .</seg>
<seg id=582>with china 's rapid economic development , china 's international status is on a rise .</seg>
<seg id=583>more and more american people have realized that the improvement and development of sino - american relations is in the interest of the us and china .</seg>
<seg id=584>half a year ago , it was right here in the lobby that we successfully launched the six - party talk process and set the direction to peacefully settle the nuclear issue .</seg>
<seg id=585>over half a year , all the parties have held non-stop talks and negotiations and have made great and thorough preparations for a new round of talks . through this process , all sides have promoted the understanding of one another 's stances .</seg>
<seg id=586>now , all the parties expect to discuss the core issues during the second round of talks and expect to attain a concrete result . all agree to ease the concerns through concerted steps and expect the peace process the six - party talks have brought about to continue .</seg>
<seg id=587>these serve as an important basis for our talks today .</seg>
<seg id=588>the great significance of the second round of talks is to begin the discussions on the core issues , which symbolizes that the peace talks have once again moved one step forward .</seg>
<seg id=589>this round of talks will cover the issue of how to set a concrete target for settling the nuclear issue and discuss measures to be taken in the first stage to settle the nuclear issue and ways to continue the talks .</seg>
<seg id=590>as the talks go further , we will deal with more difficulties and face more challenges but this is the responsibility endowed to us by history and it is also the international community 's expectation on us .</seg>
<seg id=591>the six parties meeting here demonstrated the strong political will of the six governments and their peoples in seeking peace .</seg>
<seg id=592>our talks are aimed at expanding the common ground instead of emphasizing the differences . it is aimed at settling problems instead of intensifying the conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=593>the chinese side believes that all parties will realize the peace mission they are shouldering , respect each other , show some flexibility and narrow the gap in a constructive way and in a spirit of cooperation and understanding .</seg>
<seg id=594>following three days of talks , the second round of beijing six - party talks has completed its previously - set agendas .</seg>
<seg id=595>i 'd like to express my thanks to all the governments , leaders of the delegations and representatives as well as the staff members for their contributions .</seg>
<seg id=596>if the first round of talks has set the great target of realizing a nuclear freeze in the peninsula , then the significance of this round of talks lies in the concrete dialogues , which mark a further step towards the realization of the greater target .</seg>
<seg id=597>during the talks , all the parties held thorough and constructive discussions , using wisdom and ration to discuss ways and steps to settle the issues , bringing some valuable ideas and having made positive policy announcement .</seg>
<seg id=598>the talks have achieved a series of beneficial results and , in particular , reached agreement on the next round of talks and the establishment of a working group , which is of great significance in pushing forward the peace talk process .</seg>
<seg id=599>dear colleagues , peace and development are the main theme of our great era .</seg>
<seg id=600>the people of the six countries all of you here represent need peace , aspire for peace and love peace . all the people around the world need peace , aspire for peace and love peace .</seg>
<seg id=601>over the past three days , the international community has been watching beijing and the diaoyutai and had high expectations on this round of talks .</seg>
<seg id=602>perhaps , some people think that the results of the talks are not enough and the process is not fast enough .</seg>
<seg id=603>in my opinion , this round of talks was launched under the circumstances that the parties concerned lacked mutual trust and their differences were enlarged .</seg>
<seg id=604>the chinese government 's stance on the taiwan issue is consistent . that is to stick to the basic policy of " peaceful reunification , one country and two systems " .</seg>
<seg id=605>to this end , we have made every possible effort , showed our greatest sincerity and done a lot of work .</seg>
<seg id=606>however , our efforts are provoked by the taiwan authority and " taiwan independence " forces .</seg>
<seg id=607>we respect taiwan people 's request for democracy but we oppose " taiwan independence " forces ' activities to split taiwan from the motherland in the name of democracy .</seg>
<seg id=608>that we clearly show our determination and will to safeguard the integrity of the motherland is to protect the peace and stability across the taiwan straits .</seg>
<seg id=609>we have stated that we will do our best to peacefully realize the reunification of the motherland as long as there is only a gleam of hope .</seg>
<seg id=610>we appreciate president bush 's reiteration of the one china stance , which has given " taiwan independence " forces a clear signal .</seg>
<seg id=611>taiwan leaders have claimed that " in order to prevent china 's use of force to invade taiwan and unilaterally change the status quo , it will hold the 3.20 peaceful referendum . "</seg>
<seg id=612>this is to defame the mainland 's peace efforts and to provoke the cross - strait relations .</seg>
<seg id=613>currently , the actual threat to taiwan 's security does not come from the mainland but from the " taiwan independence " split - up activities by the taiwan authority .</seg>
<seg id=614>the " taiwan independence " split - up forces are the direct root that undermines cross - strait status quo and harms the peace in the taiwan strait .</seg>
<seg id=615>taiwan authority has distorted the mainland 's opposition to the " taiwan independence " split - up moves and its safeguarding the stability in the taiwan strait as cracking down on taiwan 's democracy and freedom , and has used it as an excuse to hold the referendum .</seg>
<seg id=616>this is a fabrication and distortion of facts and aimed at swindling sympathy and support for continuing its split - up policy .</seg>
<seg id=617>what taiwan leaders have claimed are the so - called " defense referendum " and " peace referendum " , but no matter how it is packed , such provocative move will only lead to the cross - strait antithesis and hatred , intensify cross - strait relations and push the cross - strait ties to a dangerous brink .</seg>
<seg id=618>this goes against taiwan compatriots ' mainstream will of seeking peace , stability and development . it is not to deepen taiwan 's " democracy " but to mislead and control taiwan people and is also a serious threat to the peace and stability in the asian pacific region , which is surely to draw widespread opposition from compatriots across the strait and the international community .</seg>
<seg id=619>taking a sweeping view of the chinese nation 's historical development , unification has always been the mainstream and is the trend of the times and people 's will .</seg>
<seg id=620>with the motherland becoming more and more powerful and the cross - strait cooperation being increasingly strengthened , the international community 's widespread recognition of one china has been consolidated . any split - up attempt is doomed to failure .</seg>
<seg id=621>the lunar new year is just two weeks away , which is one of the most important traditional festivals of the chinese people .</seg>
<seg id=622>during these lively and happy days , we have the custom of gathering with family members and friends and exchange gifts to express our wishes .</seg>
<seg id=623>in the spirit of conveying regards and creating business opportunities , hong kong post service is cooperating with china post to offer hong kong residents the " china - hong kong gift delivery service " to convey regards and good wishes to family members , friends and customers living in the mainland or local hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=624>for a long time , hong kong post service has been dedicated to the cooperation with other post services to offer international delivery services .</seg>
<seg id=625>as early as december 2002 , it has offered foreign wine delivery service with australia post service to provide good quality goods to hong kong residents .</seg>
<seg id=626>the cooperation with china post this time is to expand the close bilateral cooperation in the areas of postal service , postal remittance and express delivery to cross - border logistics services . the " china - hong kong gift delivery service " is specially designed to meet the increasing market demand for hong kong residents to deliver gifts to family members , friends and customers living in the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=627>the first batch of gifts include several kinds of delicately packaged gift boxes for the new year , including sweets , tea and seafood , with different prices and varieties to choose .</seg>
<seg id=628>they are very decent gifts for family members , friends or business partners living in the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=629>over the past 30 years , it has been perfectly obvious that the consumers ' right association has made its contribution to protecting consumers ' rights .</seg>
<seg id=630>to evaluate the work of the consumers ' rights association , it is better to see whether consumers ' rights have been substantially improved .</seg>
<seg id=631>i fully agree with what chairman chen said just now . over the past 30 years , not only the consumers have become aware of their own rights , all walks of life are paying more attention to consumer rights as well . this is the result of efforts made by the consumers ' right association and the government .</seg>
<seg id=632>the consumers ' right association conducts regular tests on products , carries out market investigations and research of industrial operations regarding various products and services , and issues just and objective market information to the public through the monthly magazine " choices " .</seg>
<seg id=633>the monthly magazine " choices " has won the deep trust of the residents . the current internet edition of " choices " will give full play to its functions and will help consumers get quick access to market information .</seg>
<seg id=634>the consumers ' rights association has 11 regional consumer consulting centers and 16 hot lines to offer consumers information about relevant products and services and accept their complaints .</seg>
<seg id=635>since its establishment , the consumers ' rights association has received an increasing number of inquires , from thousands of cases in 1970s when it was first established to 146,000 cases last year , an increase by 20 times . this shows that more and more consumers will refer to the reports and comments issued by the consumers ' rights association before they choose products and services .</seg>
<seg id=636>in addition , the consumers ' rights association handled more than 26,000 complaint cases this year .</seg>
<seg id=637>the consumers ' rights association occasionally criticizes individual tricky shops by name , which not only help prevent consumers from being cheated , but also aims to throw a scare into the business operators .</seg>
<seg id=638>legislator yang , on july 1 , i told you that i watched tv very closely and have done some reflection later . i saw the residents ' complaints and anger and their dissatisfaction with the government 's administration .</seg>
<seg id=639>in this respect , the government and i have been making improvements over the past 6 to 7 months . we have noticed that what the residents asked was for us to build a good economy and handle the issue of people 's well - being . we have made a lot of efforts in this regard . the residents have a lot of complaints about the 23rd article of the " basic law " , so we have revoked the 23rd article . in fact , the government has given an instant response .</seg>
<seg id=640>as for the society 's request for democracy , i also know it well .</seg>
<seg id=641>however , legislator yang , i 'd like to tell you what i 'm doing today is to ensure that everything goes smoothly after political self-criticism begins . therefore , some basic issues should be addressed first . these are two different things .</seg>
<seg id=642>what are the basic issues ?</seg>
<seg id=643>these are issues concerning the principles . some are legal issues concerning the relevant provisions of the " basic law " that are subject of our political self-criticism . how to understand it exactly is to first have this work well done .</seg>
<seg id=644>we are doing this work right now . a three - member team has begun doing this job .</seg>
<seg id=645>it will first consult with the central government and will also listen to people 's advice in hong kong . i think this is a good step and it is a decision that shows we are paying attention to opinions of the hong kong society .</seg>
<seg id=646>in today 's fiercely competitive business environment , brands are playing a key role in the success of products .</seg>
<seg id=647>to create a name brand cannot be done in just one day . it requires creative designs , good quality , interesting packages , effective marketing and constant investment .</seg>
<seg id=648>hong kong has the conditions for creating famous brands .</seg>
<seg id=649>we have relevant expertise , techniques and experience ; we have a rich resource of talents in the fields of designing , manufacturing , marketing and management . we also have a broad market .</seg>
<seg id=650>the recent implementation of cepa will increase our advantages . apart from the zero tariffs for entering the mainland 's market , its biggest advantage is to inspire businessmen to use their brains in an effort to increase the added value of their products and make the products become consumers ' popular brands in hong kong , mainland and all around the world .</seg>
<seg id=651>the " hong kong top ten renowned brands contest " launched by the association of china enterprises happens to coincide with cepa 's role in guiding hong kong products to develop in the way of high added value .</seg>
<seg id=652>over the past five years , 51 " hong kong top ten renowned brands " have been honored in the contest .</seg>
<seg id=653>however , facing mainland 's huge market , the 51 famous brands are really nothing . we need hundreds , thousands and more " hong kong famous brands " .</seg>
<seg id=654>hong kong subway has actively participated in subway projects in major cities around the mainland and has introduced into the mainland market their rich experiences through services .</seg>
<seg id=655>i 'm very pleased to see the mainland market 's affirmative appraisal of hong kong 's investment , professional services and the quality of management personnel .</seg>
<seg id=656>this kind of exchanges between shenzhen and hong kong are not only helpful to the motherland 's development , but also can create more development opportunities for hong kong businessmen . apart from accelerating the economy , it will also create more job opportunities for hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=657>thanks to the support by the central government and shenzhen special economic zone , a principle agreement on this project has been reached .</seg>
<seg id=658>this is the first time that the subway company goes beyond hong kong to participate in mainland subway development by way of investment , which will further introduce hong kong 's brands to the mainland . it is really a good news for hong kong people and the countrymen in the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=659>here , i 'd like to express my best wishes that the fourth subway line in shenzhen will be officially approved by the central government in an early date and the project 's construction will go smoothly to lay a more solid foundation for more exchanges and cooperation between shenzhen and hong kong in the future .</seg>
<seg id=660>today is the fifth day of the lunar new year . i 'm very pleased to be invited by the gold and silver trade circle to attend your new year greeting gathering and host the new year 's opening ceremony for the gold market opening session .</seg>
<seg id=661>first , i 'd like to express my new year greetings to you all and wish you to be full of vigor , good lucks and fortunes , and to fulfill your wills in the year of monkey .</seg>
<seg id=662>over the past year , the gold price has gone up dramatically . it even went beyond $400 per ounce recently , keeping a strong momentum and reflecting investors ' recovering confidence in gold .</seg>
<seg id=663>i believe that our counterparts have also been very busy over the past year .</seg>
<seg id=664>in fact , while the booming market is influenced by the outer factors , it is also a result of great efforts made by the gold and silver trade circle over the past 90 years .</seg>
<seg id=665>these efforts have not only laid a good foundation for hong kong 's gold market , but also contributed much more to hong kong 's position as an international financial center .</seg>
<seg id=666>as the saying goes , " a whole year 's work depends on a good start in spring " . i hope all members in the gold and silver trade circle will continue to make efforts next year to grasp the " golden time " of the gold and silver business , seize the opportunity of a rise in gold demand brought by the mainland 's gold market reforms , china 's accession into the wto and implementation of cepa , and continually push forward market development .</seg>
<seg id=667>i believe with the active efforts by people of the our trade , hong kong 's gold market will become more splendid .</seg>
<seg id=668>finally , i wish booming gold trade and all trades and businesses prosperous in the year of monkey .</seg>
<seg id=669>thank you all .</seg>
<seg id=670>however , the previous challenges not only lay in funding the public houses , private houses also faced a big test .</seg>
<seg id=671>after the outbreak of 1997 financial crisis , the capital foams burst , leading to a sharp decline of housing prices by 70% and severely hitting the owners . it was also the main cause for the deterioration of deflation over the past five years .</seg>
<seg id=672>now the economy is recovering . we are determined to maintain a stable environment and ensure a sustainable and stable development of the housing market .</seg>
<seg id=673>a healthy housing market is indeed of great importance to hong kong 's economic recovery .</seg>
<seg id=674>we are also dedicated to protecting and improving the living environment .</seg>
<seg id=675>our future work will be based on the principle of sustainable development to adopt better urban designs , strengthen the protection of hong kong 's natural and historical scenic spots and improve the living environment .</seg>
<seg id=676>we will pay more attention to the issue of the overall environment .</seg>
<seg id=677>the lesson of last year 's outbreak of sars epidemic in hong kong has reminded us to make efforts to create a cleaner and healthier living environment .</seg>
<seg id=678>we are intensifying our efforts to beautify the environment , plant more trees and build more parks and recreational facilities for use by the residents .</seg>
<seg id=679>here , i 'd like to express my thanks to several legislators who have made comments on the administration of justice and laws , politics , public servants , auspices organizations ' employees and safety guards in the chief executive 's administration policy report .</seg>
<seg id=680>on the scope of judicial and legal services , only legislator wu heyi and legislator zeng yucheng made their comments . they are chairman and vice chairman of the justice and legal affairs committee under the legislative council .</seg>
<seg id=681>in his administration policy report , the chief executive has proposed several measures to push forward people - oriented administration , including the strengthening of ties between major officials and the society , conducting more public policy researches , strengthening cooperation between the government and the legislative council and making serious review of the administrative system .</seg>
<seg id=682>the department of law and justice will fully participate in the above - mentioned work and is dedicated to ensuring that all government measures are in accordance with laws and procedures , especially the basic law , including its protection of residents ' basic rights and freedom . it will also keep vigilant as stated by legislator wu heyi to safeguard hong kong 's legal system and justice independence .</seg>
<seg id=683>as a key official , i will do my best to heed to the opinions of the public and the legal circle regarding issues which may cast influence on judicial affairs and the legal profession .</seg>
<seg id=684>for example , the mainland - hong kong closer economic and trade partnership arrangement is an achievement of close cooperation between the government and the various sectors , including the association of big lawyers , the association of lawyers and the chinese association of entrustment notary .</seg>
<seg id=685>we have successfully included " legal service " under cepa , which has become one of the mainland 's service sectors that are open to the outside . it has provided a new platform for the two sides to strengthen their legal service cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=686>the special team 's work is two - way . we will report our work of collecting the public opinions in hong kong to the central government .</seg>
<seg id=687>so far , we have received over 10 groups and individuals since mid - january this year .</seg>
<seg id=688>all the people agree that hong kong 's political development needs to conform to " one country , two systems " . the hong kong special administrative region is directly under the leadership of the central government .</seg>
<seg id=689>most of them think that hong kong 's political system needs some improvement . meanwhile , all of them agree that any development should conform to the basic law .</seg>
<seg id=690>some groups and individuals also have their own opinions about some procedures and legal issues .</seg>
<seg id=691>the special team will fully convey their wills , opinions and comments to the central government .</seg>
<seg id=692>in the coming one month or more , the special team will continue to receive other groups and individuals . we will continue to report received comments to the central government .</seg>
<seg id=693>this is just the first time that the special team meets with relevant departments of the central government . in the future , we will still need to follow up the work and communicate with the central government .</seg>
<seg id=694>i believe that all of you understand that the development of political system concerns the relationship between the central government and the special administrative region . the central government also has the constitutional power and obligation to review the special administrative region 's political development . we need to hold thorough discussions with the central government .</seg>
<seg id=695>the west kowloon recreational art zone is a large - scale cultural and artistic program that hong kong has never undertaken before . it is not only a program that offers residents a space for cultural and artistic recreations , but also one that can improve the quality of the residents and the city .</seg>
<seg id=696>the construction of the west kowloon recreational art zone belongs to the whole hong kong society .</seg>
<seg id=697>the government must continue to hold thorough discussions with all walks of life to pool the wisdom of the masses .</seg>
<seg id=698>we understand that we cannot only seek beautiful architectures , instead we need to ensure that they will have economic efficiency , achieve sustainable development and improve the residents ' living quality .</seg>
<seg id=699>therefore , the government pays great attention to the supporting software facilities of the west kowloon recreational art zone . they must be kept in line with the relevant measures , including facility management policies , promotion strategies for artistic performances , and publicity strategies regarding performances and exhibitions .</seg>
<seg id=700>the formulation of these relevant strategies must be based on the opinions carefully absorbed from the " customers " .</seg>
<seg id=701>the younger generation , including every young friend here , are among the main customers of the west kowloon recreational art zone in the future .</seg>
<seg id=702>we hope that the zone can satisfy the needs of both the old and young . both hong kong residents and visitors , adults and lively young people , would be so enchanted here that they feel reluctant to leave .</seg>
<seg id=703>i know you held discussions on several different aspects of the west kowloon recreational art zone this morning . some students have devoted much effort in preparation of theme reports over the past month . i believe you are already very familiar with the details of the program .</seg>
<seg id=704>i am eager to find out the results of your discussions and exchange views with you .</seg>
<seg id=705>since the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the whole world has been paying its attention to the security of sea ports , airports and borders .</seg>
<seg id=706>as the world 's largest port which transports the largest number of containers to the united states , hong kong has undoubtedly quickly responded to the " port security proposal " raised by the united states .</seg>
<seg id=707>in addition , we believe that cutting off the lifeline of terrorist groups is also an effective way to curb terrorist activities .</seg>
<seg id=708>the law enforcement agencies targeting crimes and money laundry have long been perplexed by the large amount of flow of funds through the world 's financial systems every day .</seg>
<seg id=709>as one of major financial centers in asia , we believe that cutting off terrorists ' funds is perhaps the most effective way to crack down on their structures once and for all .</seg>
<seg id=710>currently , hong kong 's legislative agencies are holding discussions on various proposals for improvement in order to tighten the current laws and regulations to crack down on funding terrorist activities , and actively coordinating with the international standards and situation , such as the new advice offered by the special team of cracking down on money laundry activities , to amend the laws .</seg>
<seg id=711>in addition , we are seeking to adopt more perfect regulations on information disclosure to enable relevant agencies and individuals to report suspicious transactions .</seg>
<seg id=712>" balance " is also a key in this work : effective investigation power , the freedom protected by the constitution , personal privacies , the efficiency of economic and financial systems are all factors that need to be considered .</seg>
<seg id=713>our control measures are based on legal systems , transparency , equality and efficiency .</seg>
<seg id=714>in fact , hong kong 's service industry has a number of advantages in a wide range of fields .</seg>
<seg id=715>hong kong 's professional and business service talents are very familiar with international and mainland 's business operations</seg>
<seg id=716>hong kong 's professional accountant , financial , legal and arbitration services are the best partners of enterprises in the mainland during their course of internationalization and linking to the world markets .</seg>
<seg id=717>as for our transportation , construction , design and marketing , management consultancy , information technology and conference as well as exhibition services , they are helpful for mainland 's enterprises to improve their overall productivity and competitiveness and assist enterprises and products in drawing up market expansion strategies and improve the image of their brands .</seg>
<seg id=718>and tourism , healthcare and insurance services are more helpful to the development of mainland 's relevant markets and sectors to improve their service standards .</seg>
<seg id=719>the close cooperation between the two sides ' service industries will greatly enhance their respective advantages and is helpful for them to face various opportunities and challenges brought about by economic globalization .</seg>
<seg id=720>to promote the service industry 's development in the mainland market , the director of the financial department and i , along with officials from relevant policy and enforcement departments and representatives of several sectors , held substantial and valuable discussions in beijing with mainland 's relevant departments and counterparts on topics of mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other issues of concern by the industry .</seg>
<seg id=721>we are pleased to have signed agreements on mutual professional qualification recognition and cooperation in the three areas of construction , structure engineering and insurance , which is an important step taken by our service industry in order to develop in the mainland market .</seg>
<seg id=722>after the meeting , hong kong 's professional groups have also established closer ties with mainland 's administrative agencies to lay a good foundation for the friendly cooperation in the next stage .</seg>
<seg id=723>i believe most of the hong kong residents love their motherland and hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=724>in fact , the economic , social , political and cultural links and relationships between the mainland and hong kong have long been closely bound up before and after hong kong 's return .</seg>
<seg id=725>in the economic front , we 've seen that since the country 's four modernization drive and the reform and opening up launched over 20 years ago , hong kong 's industries have had the opportunities to move to the north and find a new development space , which has drawn closer the relationship between hong kong and the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=726>recently , we have the opportunity to reach the closer economic partnership agreement with the central government , which enables hong kong 's service sectors to gain new opportunities to more actively and extensively participate in mainland 's economic development and make contributions to the nation and hong kong . it will also draw closer the ties between hong kong and the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=727>in social development , we 've noticed that the country develops with giant strides with each passing day .</seg>
<seg id=728>hong kong residents are very happy to see beijing 's successful bid for the 2008 olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=729>several months ago , hong kong people were also pleased to see yang liwei 's visit to hong kong , why ?</seg>
<seg id=730>because everybody and every hong kong resident is proud of such achievement of the nation .</seg>
<seg id=731>i know the legislative council began to discuss the issue of a permanent legislative council office building with the government as early as 10 years ago .</seg>
<seg id=732>likewise , the government has been considering a long - term plan of moving the government headquarters over the past 10 years .</seg>
<seg id=733>so , i understand that some legislators will be disappointed by the government 's decision to postpone the tianmajian development project , which includes the new legislative council building .</seg>
<seg id=734>i understand that the legislators will feel wronged to continue their work in a poor environment during this period of time .</seg>
<seg id=735>however , as i 've told the colleagues in the government who have also been affected by the decision , i hope all of you will first think about the public interests , understand relevant situations and be more patient during this period of time .</seg>
<seg id=736>i had explained to the administrative management commission of the legislative council earlier several times . the government , taking into consideration of the current financial situation and that following last year 's sars outbreak , believes that it is not the right time now to carry out the tianmajian construction project or the construction of other large - scale office buildings .</seg>
<seg id=737>the postponement of construction of the new legislative council office building at tianmajian will help ease the government 's financial burden over the coming few years . it is in the interests of the public and will be accepted by the public .</seg>
<seg id=738>the government will restart the new legislative council office building construction project in tianmajian when the public financial situation sees some improvement . that is what we are planning to do .</seg>
<seg id=739>the country is very concerned about hong kong . the president and the premier are also very concerned about hong kong . we know that they and the central government will do their best to have this job well done .</seg>
<seg id=740>good news will continue to come in the areas of tourism , finance , infrastructure construction coordination , shipping rights , zero tariffs of products and the service sectors .</seg>
<seg id=741>i also sincerely hope that with its economic recovery , hong kong will make better use of its advantages to make greater contributions to the national development .</seg>
<seg id=742>during my meeting with premier wen jiabao , i , on behalf of hong kong , expressed my congratulation to the nation 's proud achievement under his leadership over the past difficult year . although the future will still be full of challenges , as you 've listened to his work report , he is full of confidence , which has deeply inspired us .</seg>
<seg id=743>premier wen told me that it was of great significance for us to fully understand the policy of " one country , two systems " by reviewing mr. deng xiaoping 's important exposition on " one country , two systems " 20 years ago , which is helpful to the development of our political system in the future .</seg>
<seg id=744>he also told me that hong kong people should really grasp this opportunity and focus on economic development to improve people 's well - being . he said he had full confidence in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=745>later , i 'll meet with guangdong party sectary mr. zhang dejiang and governor mr. huang huahua to discuss with them how to further promote our cooperation and gain a bigger two - win on the current basis .</seg>
<seg id=746>the last point is " hong kong administered by hong kong people " that has been very familiar to you recently . this policy requires that hong kong should be administered by people consisting mainly of hong kong patriots .</seg>
<seg id=747>as for patriots , there has been a very definite standard . they should be hong kong residents who are patriotic and respect and love their nation , who sincerely support the country 's resumption of sovereignty over hong kong , and who will not do things to harm the country and hong kong . this is what a patriot is . these patriots shall form the mainstay in the administration of hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=748>i 'd like to reiterate that most of the hong kong residents love their country .</seg>
<seg id=749>here , i 'm not referring to the ordinary hong kong residents , but those who participate in hong kong 's public affairs and the senior members in the administrative , legislative and judicial agencies .</seg>
<seg id=750>when they are sworn into office , they are required to express their support to the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china according to the basic law and to pledge their loyalty to the hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china .</seg>
<seg id=751>the five or six principles and important considerations i mentioned above are actually long - term guidelines and policies that have been adopted since the 1980s when hong kong 's future was discussed and the joint declaration and the basic law were formulated . they have remained unchanged and will never change because these are a series of long - term guidelines and policies for the country to resume its sovereignty over hong kong and are the country 's basic policies , which will never change .</seg>
<seg id=752>great inventions of far - reaching significance have come about one after another since the birth of the intellectual property right system hundreds of years ago and since the industrial revolution in particular .</seg>
<seg id=753>over the past 20 years , the intellectual property right system has served as a basic legal system and an important policy to accelerate technological renovations in various countries , and has played a key role in developing the economy and increasing international competitiveness .</seg>
<seg id=754>currently , with the fast development of science and technology and the economic globalization , the creation , occupation and the use of knowledge and intelligence resources as well as the number and the quality of owned intellectual property rights have become an important basis for a country to participate in the international competition .</seg>
<seg id=755>therefore , the strengthening of international exchanges and cooperation on protection of intellectual property rights is of great significance in establishing a just and rational international economic new order and promoting the world 's economic prosperity and development .</seg>
<seg id=756>the chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights .</seg>
<seg id=757>from the beginning of reforms and opening up , our country has started to build the intellectual property right system . following 20 years of efforts , we have formed a relatively complete intellectual property right legal system and established an intellectual property right protection system combined with legal and administrative enforcement . we 've done a lot of work in the protection of intellectual property rights and made important contributions to accelerating scientific and technological progress as well as social and economic development .</seg>
<seg id=758>as mankind enters the information society in the 21st century , the scientific and technological revolutions will generate unprecedented driving force in pushing forward the development of social productivity .</seg>
<seg id=759>the further improvement of our country 's intellectual property right system and strengthening of international exchanges and cooperation in the protection of intellectual property rights are necessary in order to further open up our country in the new century . it is also required for building a socialist modern country and realizing the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .</seg>
<seg id=760>we are willing to join hands with all the countries to make great efforts to establish a just and rational intellectual property right system that is helpful to promote the science and technology development in various countries and to create a sound environment in terms of respecting knowledge , advocating science and technology and protecting intellectual property rights .</seg>
<seg id=761>to speed up the organization 's mechanism construction is the current top priority facing the shanghai cooperation organization .</seg>
<seg id=762>through all parties ' concerted efforts , great progress has been made in the preparation work for the establishment of the secretariat and a regional anti-terrorism agency .</seg>
<seg id=763>we will continue to make efforts to ensure the official launch of the secretariat within this year and the establishment of the regional anti-terrorism agency at an earlier possible date .</seg>
<seg id=764>as the host country of the organization 's secretariat , the chinese government has decided to offer a secretariat office building for free to show that it pays great importance to the shanghai organization .</seg>
<seg id=765>in the future , we will also continue to offer full support to the smooth operation of the secretariat .</seg>
<seg id=766>deepening and expanding security cooperation have long been the priorities of the shanghai organization .</seg>
<seg id=767>we will never lose our vigilance on and tolerate the " three forces " , which pose great threats to member states across this region .</seg>
<seg id=768>we should make long - standing and unremitting efforts to eliminate these evil forces to effectively safeguard the peace and stability of the region .</seg>
<seg id=769>we should list the anti-drug issue onto the security cooperation agenda as soon as possible in order to cut off the funding of the " three forces " and to more completely and effectively crack down on the " three forces " .</seg>
<seg id=770>economic cooperation is an important basis and prior task for the shanghai cooperation organization .</seg>
<seg id=771>education is the cornerstone of modern civilization .</seg>
<seg id=772>to raise the quality of the nationals and to improve the state 's comprehensive strength , education must be greatly developed .</seg>
<seg id=773>rural education has a widespread influence and concerns the rural economy and the overall social development .</seg>
<seg id=774>since the reforms and opening up , great and substantial changes have taken place in our country 's rural areas , which are highly attributable to the development of education , especially the rural education .</seg>
<seg id=775>the adoption of the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output in rural areas has greatly emancipated the productive forces .</seg>
<seg id=776>there is a reason as to why it has been possible to see the widespread use of advanced and practical technologies in agriculture , the emerging of rural enterprises and the large movement of surplus rural labor forces to costal regions and urban areas . a fundamental cause is the solid basis of hundreds of millions of rural labor who have received compulsory education . the popularization of compulsory education in rural areas has been very fruitful and cannot be ignored .</seg>
<seg id=777>currently , our country 's agricultural and rural economic development has come to a critical stage . an overall improvement of the quality of the rural labor force is urgently needed for developing a high - quality , high efficiency , environmentally friendly and safe agriculture , for expansion of rural industrial business operations and for movement of surplus rural labor forces .</seg>
<seg id=778>the emergence of the world 's new scientific and technological revolution and the drive for building a better - off society have raised a higher demand on the rural population with respect to the quality in such areas as science and technology , culture , ideology and ethics .</seg>
<seg id=779>without the comprehensive " nine - year compulsory education " and the overall improvement of the farmers ' quality , the target of a fully better - off society is hard to reach .</seg>
<seg id=780>we must fully understand the basic , leading and overall role of rural education in the full construction of a better - off society .</seg>
<seg id=781>the consultants and distinguished guests attending the meeting include senior leaders of famous multinational corporations , renowned international economists and experienced experts as well as scholars .</seg>
<seg id=782>i 've deeply felt the consultants ' sincere spirit of cooperation and positive and practical attitude .</seg>
<seg id=783>to give a full play of our cooperative spirit and collective wisdom is not only helpful to planning and promoting guangdong 's development , but also to promoting our cooperation and development in all fields .</seg>
<seg id=784>i have been looking forward to the " 2003 international consultancy conference on guangdong 's economic development " to listen to your valuable advice on guangdong 's economic and social development .</seg>
<seg id=785>today , we meet here for one common goal : to strengthen cooperation and exchanges , expand the space for development , inject vitality to guangdong 's economic and social development and to create opportunities for your own development .</seg>
<seg id=786>china 's accession into the wto symbolizes a new stage of its opening up . we are now participating in the international competitions more extensively , in broader fields and at a higher level .</seg>
<seg id=787>guangdong is a province in the chinese mainland with a most overseas - oriented economy and it has first faced the development opportunities and grim challenges ever seen .</seg>
<seg id=788>under such circumstances , we must tightly seize new opportunities , face new challenges , improve the overall international competitiveness , actively push forward the modernization drive and make great efforts to break new grounds for economic cooperation in order to realize mutual complement of advantages , mutual benefits , long - term cooperation and common development .</seg>
<seg id=789>guangdong people are dedicated to the full construction of a better - off society and speeding up the modernization drive , which will create more development opportunities and space for all friends .</seg>
<seg id=790>guangdong 's economy , which is full of vitality and broad prospect , is moving to a higher level with a strong momentum .</seg>
<seg id=791>the iraqi temporary governing council and the us occupation authority have recently signed an agreement , announcing a timetable for returning power to iraq in stages by next june .</seg>
<seg id=792>the agreement has been barely accepted by the international community . although the eu 's foreign minister meeting welcomed the agreement , france said " the process is too slow " . while " inspired " by the power transfer plan , un secretary general annan said that un 's role in iraq was " premature " . russia has cast doubts on the legitimacy of the agreement .</seg>
<seg id=793>the iraqi people have a cold response . the us media even believe that " this is a big gamble " .</seg>
<seg id=794>all in all , people have cast doubts on it and would rather wait and see .</seg>
<seg id=795>it 's not without reason that the international community has great doubts on it .</seg>
<seg id=796>because people have noticed that the us is not willing to hand over the power back to iraq . the handover will be incomplete and is sure to leave many problems .</seg>
<seg id=797>firstly , members of the transitional government to be set up next may are not directly elected by the iraqi people , instead they will be elected by the " transitional national representative congress " to be elected by the election committees in 18 provinces .</seg>
<seg id=798>it is hard to clear the doubt of being controlled by the us . its legitimacy will also be doubted .</seg>
<seg id=799>secondly , after announcing the power transfer , the us army will not withdraw . the only change will be from the original " military occupation " to " military presence " .</seg>
<seg id=800>the us government announced on november 18th that it had decided to impose quota restrictions on three chinese textile export products , including textile cloth , bras and robes .</seg>
<seg id=801>it is very regrettable that the us government 's trade protectionist move came as china was making continuous efforts to expand sino - us bilateral economic and trade cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=802>under the current economic globalization , it is very inappropriate for the us to reset quotas on chinese textile exports .</seg>
<seg id=803>firstly , such abuse of " quotas " hinders the implementation of wto 's free trade principle .</seg>
<seg id=804>while advocating " free trade " on one hand , it has frequently resorted to the " quota " on the other hand to rebuild a trade barrier . does n't this seem too arbitrary and unfair ?</seg>
<seg id=805>secondly , the " quota " has curbed the good momentum of the sino - us economic and trade development .</seg>
<seg id=806>since china and the us reached agreement on china 's accession into the wto in 1999 , the us exports to china have seen an average rise of 15% annually .</seg>
<seg id=807>from january to september this year , us exports to china rose 26.2% compared with the same period last year .</seg>
<seg id=808>over the past two years , the exports of us textile material and finished products to china went up sharply .</seg>
<seg id=809>in fact , today 's china has become a country that receives the fastest increase of us exports in the world .</seg>
<seg id=810>bush 's failure to reach his targets during his visit to britain has many causes , the most important of which is that after the end of the cold war , the us has become the world 's sole superpower , disregarding anyone else under its swelling unilateralism .</seg>
<seg id=811>the us launched the war against iraq without un authorization and has showed no respect to its allies ' advice on major international issues including iraq 's reconstruction . its stubbornness has aroused widespread resentment .</seg>
<seg id=812>a recent poll issued by the european commission showed that 68% of eu 's citizens held that the us did not have sufficient reasons to launch the war against iraq while 53% believed that the us posed threats to the world 's peace .</seg>
<seg id=813>secondly , the us stresses anti-terrorism and expects its allies to provide personnel and funds while turning a blind eye to their concerns .</seg>
<seg id=814>the us is holding tightly in hands iraq 's reconstruction projects and has offered the first contract bids to domestic companies , unwilling to share with others . in the steel trade dispute , the wto has ruled that the us high tariffs are against its regulations . the british business and industrial sectors had expected bush to make some concessions during his visit but he failed to respond to the request .</seg>
<seg id=815>thirdly , the us regards its values as the top ones and has imposed them on other countries . it insists on carrying out democratic reforms in the middle east countries , which has drawn oppositions . some allied countries have asked the us to respect islamic nations ' culture and unique characteristics , believing that one of the causes that has led to us army 's being bogged down in iraq is the bitter pill of its " disrespect " .</seg>
<seg id=816>however , bush will not change his mind in spite of extensive criticism and oppositions . he , once again , defended his policy towards iraq , stressing that the us - british allied forces would continue to resort to force to deal with the violence in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=817>just as bush has failed to have his wishes fulfilled during his visit to britain , the situation in iraq may fail as well to develop in a way that the white house expects .</seg>
<seg id=818>following half a year 's debate , an advance team of japan 's self-defense force was eventually deployed to iraq at the end of 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=819>this was the first time that japan has deployed troops in an overseas battlefield since the end of the second world war .</seg>
<seg id=820>it reflects japan 's will of becoming a political and military power and also symbolizes the change of japan 's defense strategies .</seg>
<seg id=821>the deployment of the self-defense force has attracted great attention , as it is not an isolated incident .</seg>
<seg id=822>japan has used the opportunity of the war in afghanistan to make a breakthrough of deploying the self-defense force abroad . it has made use of the issue of the korean peninsular to adopt the " emergency legislation " to foreshadow the self-defense force 's use of force and even launching preemptive attacks . koizumi 's cabinet has recently passed " the basic plan of supporting iraq 's reconstruction " , which has foreshadowed sending troops to iraq .</seg>
<seg id=823>step by step , it has eventually broken the restrictions imposed by japan 's peaceful constitution and sent troops to overseas battlefields .</seg>
<seg id=824>in addition , japan is also seeking to amend " the conception for basic defense forces " in 2004 to legalize and perpetuate overseas military deployment and plans to set up a " permanent troop " for overseas deployment .</seg>
<seg id=825>meanwhile , citing the so - called " north korean missile threats " , the japanese cabinet meeting has decided to deploy a missile defense system at the beginning of 2004 , introducing the us " standard - 3 missile " and the " patriots - 3 missile " to intercept outer atmosphere missiles and missiles returning to the atmosphere , building a double missile interception network .</seg>
<seg id=826>it is not hard to see that japan 's self-defense force is moving toward a regular army that is capable of " attacks and defense " . the " self-defense force " that is so called " specializing in defense " will exist in name only .</seg>
<seg id=827>that the japanese move has attracted much attention is firstly because these military decisions have impacts on japan 's peaceful constitution .</seg>
<seg id=828>after his visit to the yasukuni shrine , koizumi accepted japanese reporters ' interview to defend his action .</seg>
<seg id=829>his remarks were full of contradictions and loopholes .</seg>
<seg id=830>the reporters asked koizumi why he paid respect to the shrine . koizumi answered : " japan 's peace and prosperity were realized at the sacrifice of the war victims .</seg>
<seg id=831>my paying respect is to pray for japan 's peace and prosperity . "</seg>
<seg id=832>just ask , do koizumi 's so - called " war victims " include world war ii class a war criminals including hideki tojo ?</seg>
<seg id=833>does he mean that japan 's post-war peace and prosperity should be attributed to the contributions of those class a war criminals ?</seg>
<seg id=834>some reporters asked why he chose january 1 to pay his respect to the yasukuni shrine .</seg>
<seg id=835>koizumi said that it was a japanese tradition to worship in temples on the first day of the new year and many people go to temples to worship .</seg>
<seg id=836>it is understandable that ordinary people mourn relatives and friends , and many victims ' family members have clearly stated that they worshiped in the shrine only to mourn their relatives and friends and firmly opposed enshrining class a war criminals in the yasukuni shrine .</seg>
<seg id=837>the chinese people are reasonable . we firmly hold that the japanese people should be separated from a small number of militarists and the ordinary people should be separated from the rightists . the ordinary people ' paying respect to the yasukuni shrine is not the crux of historical issues .</seg>
<seg id=838>unity is strength .</seg>
<seg id=839>this is an irrefutable truth .</seg>
<seg id=840>to reach the great target of the full construction of a better - off society and complete the solemn undertaking of the chinese nation 's rejuvenation , we must unite all forces that can be united .</seg>
<seg id=841>the work of the patriotic united front in the new century and the new stage must be based on and carried out in accordance with this .</seg>
<seg id=842>we will further stick to and improve the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the communist party of china , further consolidate and develop the patriotic united front and bring every positive factor into play to inject new momentum to the chinese nation 's great rejuvenation .</seg>
<seg id=843>over the past year , the people 's political consultancy conference has been sticking to the two themes of unity and democracy , earnestly fulfilling various obligations , and has played an important role in accelerating the country 's overall economic and social development and in safeguarding a stable situation for reform and development .</seg>
<seg id=844>in the new year , we hope that the people 's political consultancy conference will , by focusing on the prior tasks of the party and the nation , do a better job in political consultation , democratic supervision and participation in political affairs . we also hope that it will carry on its good tradition , make use of its own advantages , conduct thorough investigations and researches , actively offer advice and contribute more to the full construction of a better - off society .</seg>
<seg id=845>from january 4 to 6 , the 12th leaders summit of the south asian association for regional cooperation ( saarc ) , which was postponed for one full year , was held in islamabad . the conference has adopted several documents including the " south asian free trade agreement framework treaty " , " saarc 's annex agreement on anti-terrorism " and the " south asian social charter " . it announced that saarc members would be dedicated to the common development and cooperation in the fields of economy , culture and anti-terrorism .</seg>
<seg id=846>during the saarc conference , the bilateral talks between indian prime minister vajpayee and pakistani president musharraf had attracted much attention .</seg>
<seg id=847>at the last summit meeting , musharraf and vajpayee shook hands with each other , but people had not expected too much in the development of the two country 's bilateral relations .</seg>
<seg id=848>two years later , due to the two sides ' series of key moves of normalizing diplomatic ties , resuming land and air transportation and realizing a cease - fire in the kashmir region , indian - pakistani ties continue to ease up and their top leaders have eventually held talks using the opportunity of the saarc meeting .</seg>
<seg id=849>the two countries have moved one big step in improving bilateral ties . south asia 's regional cooperation is facing a turn for the better .</seg>
<seg id=850>although indian foreign minister singh said on 4th that the talks were of " courtesy " , people believe that the meeting symbolizes that indian - pakistani ties will make more positive and practical changes .</seg>
<seg id=851>the two leaders have realized that tension and confrontation are not in the interests of their own countries but will lead to missed economic development opportunities .</seg>
<seg id=852>with the on - going economic globalization , strengthening cooperation and developing economy have become the top priorities of the two governments .</seg>
<seg id=853>although there is no official announcement of the result of georgia 's presidential election on 4th , a victory by the national movement party leader saakashvili , who is a candidate recommended by the right - wing party alliance , is inevitable .</seg>
<seg id=854>georgia 's central election committee announced on 7th that based on 89% votes already counted , more than 95% voters supported saakashvili .</seg>
<seg id=855>some heads of states of the commonwealth of independent states have sent congratulatory telegraphs to the young politician .</seg>
<seg id=856>in fact , as early as on the night of the election , saakashvili had already announced his victory .</seg>
<seg id=857>he claimed that the result was the " victory of the people " and said that georgia would take quick moves to create a new future .</seg>
<seg id=858>when interviewed by news medias , many voters said that voting for saakashvili meant choosing " new hopes " .</seg>
<seg id=859>even former president shevardnadz , who was forced to step down , also expressed his support to his former political opponent , praising him as " young , energetic and well educated " .</seg>
<seg id=860>while placing hopes on saakashvili , people have also noticed that after the resignation of shevardnadz , no great changes have taken place in the situation of georgia .</seg>
<seg id=861>this is to say that the newly - elected president will still have to face the old problems .</seg>
<seg id=862>the past year was an important and very unusual one in our country 's development course .</seg>
<seg id=863>we fought an arduous war against the sudden appearance of the sars epidemic and won a great victory ; our economy maintained a good development momentum and has entered a new stage , with the per capita gdp topping $1,000 ; the shenzhou - vi spacecraft completed a successful flight , realizing chinese people 's dream of space flight ; the nation is united , the society is progressing and the people 's living standards keep improving .</seg>
<seg id=864>our country 's achievements in various fields have attracted the world 's attention . all the people in the country have made great efforts and shown their courage and strength of creating wonders in spite of difficulties .</seg>
<seg id=865>looking forward to the new year , we are full of confidence and hopes .</seg>
<seg id=866>looking at the domestic and international situations , our country is at an important moment full of strategic opportunities that we must tightly grasp and are able to make great achievements .</seg>
<seg id=867>we should stick to the guidelines of the important thoughts of the deng xiaoping theory and the " three represents " , fully carry through the party 's essences of the 16th national congress and the third session of the 16th congress of the central committee to seriously implement the central committee 's important policies and overall plans on this year 's work and to continue to push forward reforms and opening up as well as our modernization drive .</seg>
<seg id=868>to have this year 's work well done , we must have a right understanding of the current situation to see both favorable conditions and new opportunities and unfavorable conditions and challenges , and to strengthen our senses of responsibility , urgency and hardship .</seg>
<seg id=869>the three - party talks on the iraqi issue were held on 19th at the un 's headquarters in new york . un secretary general annan held discussions with representatives from the iraqi temporary governing council and us - british allied forces authority , with the focus on how the un should play its role in iraq 's reconstruction .</seg>
<seg id=870>the meeting discussed issues on iraq 's politics , humanitarian , and appointment of a un special envoy to iraq . the three sides have candidly exchanged ideas on the issues .</seg>
<seg id=871>as the us and britain 's power transfer plan is facing oppositions , it will naturally attract attentions to whether and how the un will interfere in iraq 's reconstruction .</seg>
<seg id=872>since the us announced the end of major wars in iraq in early may last year , iraq has seen a continuous turbulent situation . attacks against the occupation come one after another , resulting in heavy casualties and great chaos .</seg>
<seg id=873>although former iraqi president saddam was arrested on december 13 last year , the us has had little time to cheer because the security situation did not see any improvement and the occupation authority found itself bogged down in difficulties as opposition activities intensified .</seg>
<seg id=874>on the other hand , the iraqi people and arab nations have called on foreign troops to withdraw from iraq , hand over the power to the iraqi people and let them rule their own country .</seg>
<seg id=875>meanwhile , the us and britain are seeking to reconstruct the iraqi regime according to their wills , on the basis of which they will gradually withdraw from the mire in a " decent " way .</seg>
<seg id=876>therefore , the way and process of power transfer have become the current focus of the iraqi issue .</seg>
<seg id=877>the power - transfer idea proposed by the us and british governing authority and the iraqi temporary governing council last november is as follows : a iraq 's transitional government will be set up by july 1 via election by the " transitional national congress " , while the delegates attending the congress will be elected by the " provincial election committee " .</seg>
<seg id=878>however , the shiite muslims , which are the majority of the population , have stressed that a direct national election should be held to show a true and fair power transfer to iraq .</seg>
<seg id=879>us secretary of state powell 's recent visit to russia still attracts much attention .</seg>
<seg id=880>this is because , on one hand , us - russian relations are very important and have far - reaching influence on today 's world .</seg>
<seg id=881>more importantly , powell 's visit to moscow had substantial content and gave a clear signal that russian - us relations had clouded over .</seg>
<seg id=882>if the cloud is not cleared in time , the two countries ' ties will see a bleak prospect .</seg>
<seg id=883>although washington and moscow have an unblocked channel for dialogue , powell still decided to expound his ideas in an article carried in russia 's influential newspaper , the news .</seg>
<seg id=884>powell pointed out in the article that the us had been perplexed by a series of incidents in russia 's domestic and diplomatic affairs over the past few months .</seg>
<seg id=885>he believed that the russian authority had not been completely checked by the law . key factors in a citizenry society including press freedom , development of political parties are not firm enough .</seg>
<seg id=886>russia 's policies in chechnya and its attitudes towards neighboring commonwealth independent states caused more concerns in the us .</seg>
<seg id=887>in a diplomat 's view , making known one 's opinion through public media is the " last ditch " of communication .</seg>
<seg id=888>the aim of the us choice gives much food for thought . it is obvious to see russia 's embarrassment and displeasure over the issue .</seg>
<seg id=889>( international ) flu spread peaks in the united states</seg>
<seg id=890>xinhua news agency report of december 31 from los angeles ( by staff reporter yan liang ) - the us disease control and prevention center said on 31st that the most serious flu epidemic in 30 years in the united states had reached its peak , with 45 of us ' 50 states reporting the wide spread of the flu and the deaths caused by the flu increasing rapidly .</seg>
<seg id=891>according to the center 's statistics as of december 20 , the death toll caused by the flu had hit a record by accounting for 7.8% of all deaths during the same period .</seg>
<seg id=892>at least 42 children have died from the flu across the us . adult deaths are also rising rapidly but so far no exact statistics are available .</seg>
<seg id=893>experts have attributed the serious spread of the flu in 2003 to two reasons : firstly , the flu was not of " panama a " type , which could n't be prevented by the vaccine produced previously ; secondly , since there was a surplus of vaccine last year , the two major vaccine suppliers had reduced their production to 83 million units , causing a shortage of vaccine supply this year .</seg>
<seg id=894>although an average of 36,000 people die from flu and 114,000 others are hospitalized every year in the united states , the social panic caused by the spread of the flu this time was rarely seen before .</seg>
<seg id=895>us epidemic disease expert , william thompson , said that the flu was the most serious in 30 years in the united states and it came earlier than before , which had widely spread in many schools . long queues were seen where vaccine injections are offered .</seg>
<seg id=896>facing the serious situation , the us health department has opened an emergency center and dispatched medical expert teams to all the states .</seg>
<seg id=897>recently , parts of our country have been hit by the highly infectious bird flu epidemic .</seg>
<seg id=898>the party 's central committee and the state council have paid high attention , quickly made a series of important decisions , and come up with clear and definite guidelines , policies and measures for the prevention work .</seg>
<seg id=899>all regions and departments concerned have taken emergent actions to do their best to prevent the spread of the epidemic in accordance with the arrangement of the party central committee and the state council .</seg>
<seg id=900>currently , the prevention work of the bird flu is being carried out nationwide in an emergent but orderly way .</seg>
<seg id=901>the highly infectious bird flu is a fast - spreading and seriously harmful animal disease that greatly endangers husbandry production and people 's health and safety .</seg>
<seg id=902>to conscientiously do a good job in the prevention of the highly infectious bird flu concerns the masses ' health and safety , agricultural development and farmers ' income growth and overall economic development as well as social stability . all regions and departments must , under the guidance of the important ideas of the " three represents " and in accordance with the requirements set forth in the " animal quarantine law of the people 's republic of china " , strengthen leadership , provide close cooperation , depend on science , observe the laws in the prevention work , carry out the mass prevention work in a coordinated manner , take decisive measures and earnestly implement various preventive measures in the spirit of being highly responsible to the people , in order to win the war against the bird flu .</seg>
<seg id=903>as the world 's largest debtor country , us is once again facing an increasing amount of foreign debt .</seg>
<seg id=904>the us treasure department announced on january 16 that by the end of september , us debts owed to various foreign creditors had totaled $6.494 trillion , up 2.2% from the previously announced figure .</seg>
<seg id=905>on an average basis , each american has a foreign debt of over $20,000 .</seg>
<seg id=906>coincidently , one week ago , the international monetary fund issued a research report which harshly criticized and warned about the us unstable financial basis and pointed out that the record - setting us foreign debts had reached a level that might endanger the world financial stability .</seg>
<seg id=907>statistics showed that foreign private investors have controlled nearly 40% of us government 's bonds .</seg>
<seg id=908>this has reminded us that in the first half of the 20th century , keynesian advised president roosevelt to adopt a deficit policy to spur the economy while raising foreign loans to deal with the financial deficits .</seg>
<seg id=909>the move has played an important role in accelerating the " effective demands " to settle the emergency of an economic crisis .</seg>
<seg id=910>however , people have noticed that several previous us administrations have tended to regard it as a " panacea " .</seg>
<seg id=911>however , since president regan advocated a tax cut - off and military build - up in 1980s of the 20th century , us financial deficits have been on a gradual rise and it has eventually become the largest debtor country .</seg>
<seg id=912>the commencement of the first round of six - party talks is an important step in the peaceful settlement process of the dialogue on the korean peninsula 's nuclear issue .</seg>
<seg id=913>the common ground reached by various parties during this round of talks has laid an essential foundation for the talks to continue , and has further defined the targets , ways and policies to settle the nuclear issue in the korean peninsula .</seg>
<seg id=914>over the past few months , the parties concerned have insisted in peacefully resolving the nuclear issue in the korean peninsula through dialogue . on the basis of the first round of the six - party talks , all parties have conducted extensive coordination and discussions at different levels and have made unremitting efforts to begin the second round of talks in an early date .</seg>
<seg id=915>meanwhile , north korea and the us have further shown their flexibility to some extent .</seg>
<seg id=916>the preparation for the talks has made important progress so far . the success of the talks is the common hope of all parties .</seg>
<seg id=917>what can be achieved in the second round of six - party talks and whether the talks will continue have attracted much attention from all parties concerned and the international community .</seg>
<seg id=918>in this regard , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman said that the target of the six - party talks is to maintain and push forward the process of a peaceful settlement through dialogues . we are willing to make concerted efforts with all parties concerned .</seg>
<seg id=919>the chinese side 's basic starting point is to safeguard peace and stability in the korean peninsular and realize the target of a nuclear - free peninsular .</seg>
<seg id=920>the chinese side holds that as long as the parties attending the meeting show sincerity , mutual respect and equality in the discussions , they can create favorable conditions to push forward the settlement of the relevant issues .</seg>
<seg id=921>in late 1970s last century , the us - libyan relations deteriorated . in 1981 , the two countries severed diplomatic ties .</seg>
<seg id=922>us president regan had presented a long list of crimes committed by libyan leader gaddafi , accusing libya of secretly developing nuclear weapons and conducting military interferences abroad as well as terrorism .</seg>
<seg id=923>the two sides moved from the war of words to military actions . the us launched " prairie fire " and " el dorado canyon " , two surgical air attacks against libya .</seg>
<seg id=924>later , the us imposed economic sanctions on libya , attacking , containing and threatening the country in politics , diplomacy and military .</seg>
<seg id=925>however , gaddafi never gave up under heavy pressures .</seg>
<seg id=926>currently , the us - libyan relations have warmed up . people have attributed this to the deterrent effect of the iraqi war , which seems not right .</seg>
<seg id=927>in fact , over the past years , gaddafi , who has a unique character , has been resisting the us on one hand while showing the olive branch to the us on the other , but has failed to receive any response .</seg>
<seg id=928>after the war in iraq , the strategic adjustments made by various parties in the middle east and restructuring of regional powers offered an opportunity for the resumption of us - libyan diplomatic relations .</seg>
<seg id=929>to gaddafi , resuming friendly ties with the us will end sanctions , develop the economy , improve people 's well - being , get rid of the isolation and get integrated into the international community .</seg>
<seg id=930>abandoning things that it has so far failed to get and will not get for a short while , libya will instead gain a completely new environment .</seg>
<seg id=931>from february 7 to 8 , political figures from europe , us and other parts of the world met in munich , germany , to attend the 40th munich security policy conference .</seg>
<seg id=932>the so - called " munich security policy conference " was initiated by no - governmental individuals in germany and is an international security forum sponsored by the german government . over the past few years , it has been paid increasing attention to after the 9/11 in particular and is called the " davos forum " in the field of security .</seg>
<seg id=933>one of the top agendas of the meeting is to discuss the cross - atlantic relations .</seg>
<seg id=934>remarks made by european and us political figures during and after the meeting have shown that the two sides are trying hard to clear the shadow the iraqi war has brought to their bilateral ties and are trying to go back on the track of cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=935>bertrams , director of berlin international and security affairs research institution , said this was a meeting to restore the european - us ties . both sides had the willingness of going closer once again .</seg>
<seg id=936>to the european - us relations , the new information from the meeting is that europe and the us need to resume talks . they need to seriously consider the common missions facing the two sides and find out the convergence of interests to fulfill these common missions .</seg>
<seg id=937>compared with last year 's meeting , the smell of gunpowder has disappeared in this year 's meeting and the two sides ' standpoints are getting closer .</seg>
<seg id=938>although the " old europe " represented by france and germany are still taking the iraqi war to hearts , they have expressed the willingness to " look forward " .</seg>
<seg id=939>german foreign minister fischer said during the meeting : although we have different views towards the war , we must take joint actions to ensure the peace following the iraqi war , so we must look forward .</seg>
<seg id=940>he also said although germany would not send troops to iraq , it would not hinder nato 's direct role in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=941>the united states , which has taken the initiative in modern media , has dominated most of international news coverage , with its media publicity reaching almost every corner of the world . then why does it still make such a huge investment in setting up a special satellite tv station to cover 22 counties in the middle east ?</seg>
<seg id=942>staff members in charge of the " freedom - 1 " tv station have been quoted as saying that it is to provide arab nations a news platform with " comprehensive and just viewpoints " .</seg>
<seg id=943>however , analysts have pointed out that " freedom - 1 " would become a us strategic weapon to infiltrate and invade arab nations ' public opinions and cultures .</seg>
<seg id=944>it seems that " freedom - 1 " has an extraordinary mission , which can be summed up as follows : first is to promote the " concept of freedom " .</seg>
<seg id=945>the us believes that the islamic civilization is a severe hindrance for the west to push forward modern civilization . the extremist religious forces in islamic nations in the middle east are a hotbed for international terrorism characterized as anti-us . to effectively crack down on terrorism , the islamic world must be reformed to conform with and accept western values , life styles and political systems .</seg>
<seg id=946>the us is attempting to use programs in the " freedom - 1 " to exert a subtle influence to instill its own ideology to the arab people .</seg>
<seg id=947>second is to improve the us image .</seg>
<seg id=948>the us is carrying out a unilateral foreign policy and dominating world affairs with its power . its hegemonic acts have greatly angered the arab and islamic countries .</seg>
<seg id=949>following the " 9/11 " incident , the conflict between the us , who has been long siding with israel , and the islamic world in the middle east has been intensified .</seg>
<seg id=950>under the name of eliminating weapons of mass destruction , the us invaded iraq by force without solid evidence and un authorization , which has aroused strong resentment among the muslim people .</seg>
<seg id=951>the talks between pakistani and indian officials were held from february 16 to 18 in islamabad . the hope of peace has emerged once again in the subcontinent of south asia .</seg>
<seg id=952>the two countries ' officials have agreed on a timetable and forms of future talks and have established a mechanism for continuing talks , which symbolizes the resumption of pakistani - indian dialogue process that came to a standstill two years ago , and will lay a foundation for the two countries to gradually settle all standing issues including the conflict in kashmir . it has shown the two sides ' valuable sincerity for peace .</seg>
<seg id=953>before the talks , most analysts held a cautious attitude towards the prospect of the peace process although the two countries ' ties had been warmed up by a series of bilateral goodwill moves .</seg>
<seg id=954>it 's no wonder that nobody can be very certain that the sunshine on the negotiation table today will become flashes and thunders in border areas tomorrow if looking back to the violent ups and downs in pakistani - indian relations over the past few years .</seg>
<seg id=955>however , when pakistani foreign secretary riaz khokar read the two countries ' statement with a smile , the optimistic atmosphere spread out again , which has refreshed many who have long been watching the situation in south asia .</seg>
<seg id=956>firstly , the timetable set during the meeting is very practical . the two sides have not only defined detailed negotiation timetable and topics , but also different levels of talks in accordance with the importance of the topics .</seg>
<seg id=957>secondly , the two sides have learnt lessons from the failure of direct talks between the two countries ' leaders during the agra summit meeting in july 2001 and have agreed to hold talks in " steps " , which means the talks will go from lower to higher levels in order to make full preparation for the summit talks .</seg>
<seg id=958>thirdly , after the bilateral ties saw ups and downs , the two countries have agreed that war is not a good way to solve disputes and the two sides should stay away from wars . the agreement has laid a foundation for the two countries ' leaders to reach an understanding of " no more wars for pakistan and india " .</seg>
<seg id=959>to fully and correctly understand and implement the policy of " one country , two systems " , we should integrate " one country " and " two systems " with " loving the country " and " loving hong kong " , integrate the respect to hong kong 's high autonomy with safeguarding the national sovereignty , and integrate hong kong 's maintaining capitalism with the nation 's main body 's sticking to socialism .</seg>
<seg id=960>only in this way can hong kong people 's well - being be safeguarded . and it is also in the long - term interests of all the people .</seg>
<seg id=961>since hong kong 's return , the central government has firmly implemented the policy of " one country , two systems " and has acted strictly in accordance with the basic law .</seg>
<seg id=962>the mass hong kong people have enjoyed the status of masters and unprecedented democratic rights .</seg>
<seg id=963>with the great support of the central government and the mainland , hong kong has successfully dealt with various risks and challenges including the impact brought about by the asian financial crisis , and remains the international financial , trade and shipping center .</seg>
<seg id=964>practices have proved that the policy of " one country , two systems " has a strong vitality .</seg>
<seg id=965>today 's re-publication of comrade deng xiaoping 's remarks 20 years ago has shown the central government 's firm determination to implement the policy of " one country , two systems " . it is to enable all the people to fully and correctly understand the policy and to push forward the great practice of " one country , two systems " .</seg>
<seg id=966>today , the party central committee and the state council are here to hold a state science and technology award meeting .</seg>
<seg id=967>president hu jintao gave the top prizes of the 2003 state science and technology awards to academicians liu dongsheng and wang yongzhi .</seg>
<seg id=968>the meeting awarded prizes to the " china manned space project " that has won the special prize of the state science and technology progress award and science and technology workers who have won the 2003 state science award , the state technical renovation award and the state science and technology progress award .</seg>
<seg id=969>on behalf of the party central committee and the state council , i 'd like to express my warm congratulations to all award winners .</seg>
<seg id=970>to show the sincere regards and the highest respect to science and technology workers in all fields of the country .</seg>
<seg id=971>for our country , the first 20 years of the century are an important strategic period that offers opportunities and must be tightly grasped to make great achievements .</seg>
<seg id=972>we will be dedicated to the full construction of a better - off society in a higher level that is in the interests of over one billion people .</seg>
<seg id=973>to better use this strategic period and try to make some achievement , we must attach greater importance to developing science and technology .</seg>
<seg id=974>after the " 9/11 " incident , us president bush dished out a strategy of " preemptive strike " in june 2002 and brought it into practice in us foreign policy . the us launched the first war of " preemptive strike " in iraq last march .</seg>
<seg id=975>the idea of " preemptive strike " is not only against the principles of international laws with " mutual respect to sovereignty and territorial integrity " as the core , but will inevitably result in the dangerous effect of imitation by others . new ups and downs will thus appear in the world order .</seg>
<seg id=976>when the theory of " preemptive strike " was first raised , some us politicians asked the question : " what will we do if other countries follow the us ? "</seg>
<seg id=977>as expected , over the past two years , more and more countries are claiming to launch " preemptive strike " . the squad advocating " preemptive strike " is getting bigger and bigger .</seg>
<seg id=978>this is a new trend that is worth paying attention to and study .</seg>
<seg id=979>within the month when bush proposed the strategy of " preemptive strike " , australian prime minister howard was the first to stand out to show his support .</seg>
<seg id=980>he said that once it got hard evidence that terrorists would launch attacks against australia , the country would take the " preemptive strike " strategy to launch military operations in neighboring countries .</seg>
<seg id=981>he even proposed to add the principle of " preemptive strike " into the un charter , believing that it was necessary to amend the un charter to empower various states the right of taking " preemptive strike " to crack down on terrorists or nations supporting terrorism .</seg>
<seg id=982>in northeastern asia , the " defense white paper " issued by japan 's defense agency in july 1999 proposed that japan launch " preemptive strike " on foreign bases if facing missile attacks or military invasion .</seg>
<seg id=983>following the war in iraq , japan 's calls for the " preemptive strike " strategy are getting even louder .</seg>
<seg id=984>recently , there have been a lot of international comments on us ' policy towards africa .</seg>
<seg id=985>the us " foreign policy focus " published in this january has carried an article titled " the 2004 african policy outlook " . the article says that over the past year , the bush administration 's foreign policy has brought direct or indirect negative influences on africa , especially the us dedication to the anti-terrorism war and the issue of proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction . the us cannot get away from iraq , which has distracted its attention to africa .</seg>
<seg id=986>people still remember that to show his concern about africa , the bush administration has adopted a " president helps aids emergency project " last january , promising to provide africa at least $3 billion every year .</seg>
<seg id=987>last july , president bush visited five african countries including senegal , south africa , botswana , uganda and nigeria and promised to offer african countries $15 billion for the prevention and cure of aids and another $100 million for anti-terrorism in africa . he also announced assistance programs in africa including the food emergency assistance program and education assistance program .</seg>
<seg id=988>these assistance programs were once well received in african countries and had won many praises from the international community .</seg>
<seg id=989>however , one year has past and the us has not yet to take concrete actions .</seg>
<seg id=990>africa needs emergent assistance .</seg>
<seg id=991>entering the new century , africa is facing various challenges in its development . it has established the " african union " , which is responsible for coordinating african affairs , to implement " the century development targets " set by the un in 2000 and to make great efforts to reduce hunger and poverty and promote health and education . it has adopted " the new partnership for african development " to promote african countries ' development . however , due to its poor economic basis , it has been short of development funds .</seg>
<seg id=992>the un has called on the developed countries to divert 0.7% of their total gdp to assist the least developed countries .</seg>
<seg id=993>however , us official assistance only accounts for 0.1% of its total gdp , far lower than the un request , and it stands at the last position of the donors ' list .</seg>
<seg id=994>a hot topic has been debated in europe recently : whether the " big three " meeting of german chancellor schroeder , french president chirac and british prime minister blair is gradually moving towards a mechanism .</seg>
<seg id=995>the public has called the " big three " of germany , france and britain europe 's " new troika " , with their relations called " new triangle " ties .</seg>
<seg id=996>the " new triangle " is a new thing . where will it lead to is yet to be observed but in any point of view , generally speaking , the " new triangle " seems helpful to europe 's integration process , so it can help europe play an important role in the international arena as one part of the world 's multipolarizational structure .</seg>
<seg id=997>looking back to europe 's history over the past 100 years , the german , french and british triangle ties are basically characterized by the british and french alliance containing or resisting germany .</seg>
<seg id=998>the two world wars are the proofs .</seg>
<seg id=999>during the cold war , east and west germanys were respectively bound up into the warsaw treaty organization and the nato .</seg>
<seg id=1000>after the end of the cold war , a unified germany became stronger , which has led to the imbalance in the structure of western europe . france 's doubts have increased , resulting in the failure of the " germany - france axis " and britain and france getting closer once again with the common aim of containing germany .</seg>
<seg id=1001>however , with the re-start of the " germany - france axis " over the past years and fierce clashes between the unipolarization and multipolarization in the world , the eu has been split over the issue of iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1002>the " old europe " represented by germany and france and the " new europe " represented by britain and poland took completely different stances on the issue of the iraqi war .</seg>
<seg id=1003>and the split has come at a point when the eu is about to undergo its largest expansion in history .</seg>
<seg id=1004>talking about arab countries ' reforms recently in cairo , egyptian president mubarak criticized the move by the outside world of imposing a single reform pattern on arab nations and warned that this attempt would run counter to the desires and were not in the interests of the peace and stability in the middle east region .</seg>
<seg id=1005>he believed that the reform measures should be in accordance with their own characteristics and abilities and that a single reform pattern was like turning a blind eye to different countries ' diverse cultural , social and religious characteristics .</seg>
<seg id=1006>he also pointed out that arab countries welcomed outside help during the course of reform , but such efforts should be made on the basis of understanding the different conditions of various countries and respecting their wills , in order to promote the arab countries ' reform process in the fields of politics , economy and culture .</seg>
<seg id=1007>the remarks made by the egyptian leader have reflected the common views of arab nations .</seg>
<seg id=1008>at present , under the pressure of anti-terrorism , anti-proliferation and democratic reforms , the middle east has become one of the hot spots in the world . new instabilities are brewing and will lead to restructuring .</seg>
<seg id=1009>following the two wars in afghanistan and iraq , how will iraq , which was regarded as one of the " evil axis " by the us in the past , undergo political reconstruction ?</seg>
<seg id=1010>how will various political systems and social patterns in the middle east region change ?</seg>
<seg id=1011>these are questions concerning not only the arab world and the international community , but the us and its western allies as well .</seg>
<seg id=1012>following his meeting with bahrain crown prince salman on 9th in washington d . c ., us secretary of state powell reiterated that the us would promote " western style democracy and capitalism plans " in the middle east .</seg>
<seg id=1013>he also stressed : " we are considering what else we can do and how to systematize them . "</seg>
<seg id=1014>last year was designated by the international olympic committee as the " year of culture and education " .</seg>
<seg id=1015>the beijing olympic organizing committee took the favorable opportunity in holding a series of educational activities to promote advanced culture and spread olympic knowledge .</seg>
<seg id=1016>among them , the publication of the book of " olympic knowledge for middle school students " for young readers was a very important achievement .</seg>
<seg id=1017>the book , full of pictures and stories , introduces knowledge about the olympic games and the essence of the olympic spirit through lively stories . it is a good textbook that helps young people to know more about the olympic games and arouses social enthusiasm for participating in the olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=1018>last year , the beijing olympic organizing committee specially designed a curriculum timetable with regenerated paper with olympic emblems printed thereon .</seg>
<seg id=1019>the concept of " green olympics " is that the olympic games should be prepared and hosted under the guiding principles of environmental protection , ecological balance and other ideas of sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1020>we hope that these curriculum timetables will discipline students ' acts like setting the courses and make them to gradually become the practitioner and promoter of the " green olympics " .</seg>
<seg id=1021>education is one of the key contents of the olympic games and a good demonstration of the " human - oriented olympics " .</seg>
<seg id=1022>the true objective of the olympic games is to educate young people from a new angle and in a new way to promote young people 's physical and mental development in a harmonious way .</seg>
<seg id=1023>therefore , the combination of sports and education will not only expand new grounds for the development of the education undertaking , but will make the olympic games more instructive as well .</seg>
<seg id=1024>" green olympics " is one of the three ideals of the 2008 olympic games in beijing .</seg>
<seg id=1025>its key content is to greatly improve the capital 's environmental quality to create a good environment for the olympic games and build an ecological city .</seg>
<seg id=1026>to this end , we must extensively use and adopt environmental technologies and measures , comprehensively promote large - scale environmental control work , beautify urban and rural environment and develop the environmental protection industry . we must also continue to arouse the public awareness of environmental protection and encourage the mass public to take part in various activities to improve the ecological environment .</seg>
<seg id=1027>to have the implementation work of " green olympics " well done is an important task in implementing the scientific view of people - oriented , comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable development as proposed during the third session of the 16th central committee congress of the communist party , and in promoting beijing 's economic and social development in a comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable way .</seg>
<seg id=1028>we must make it a prior focus .</seg>
<seg id=1029>to achieve the target of " green olympics " , beijing has prepared the " olympics action plan " and the " ecological and environmental protection plan " on the basis of the " tenth five - year plan " and the " bidding report " , setting new targets and plans for the environmental construction and protection work in the next few years .</seg>
<seg id=1030>the target of hosting a green olympic games will be fully realized through taking steps as planned .</seg>
<seg id=1031>on february 25 , the us state department issued the " 2003 state human rights report " , finding faults with over 190 nations including china once again like a " teacher " . it said many countries ' human rights conditions were too poor or very poor to reach the american standard ; other countries had gone backwards in key areas of human rights .</seg>
<seg id=1032>of course , there are still some countries that have seen great improvement in their human rights conditions . for example , afghanistan and iraq , but they are the " achievements " made by the us army after it overthrew the former regimes and " liberated " the two countries .</seg>
<seg id=1033>how about the human rights conditions in the us ?</seg>
<seg id=1034>like the previous years , the report says nothing .</seg>
<seg id=1035>on march 1 , the information office of china 's state council issued the " 2003 us human rights records " to make up for the inadequacy of the us human rights report .</seg>
<seg id=1036>based on a lot of evidences , the article introduces problems existing in us human rights and the us infringement on other countries ' human rights .</seg>
<seg id=1037>the american people have a historical tradition of sincerity and integrity and admitting mistakes when they have committed any .</seg>
<seg id=1038>the well - known story of george washington who chopped a cherry tree when he was a child is a lively example .</seg>
<seg id=1039>now the us has become the sole superpower in the world , but it has begun not to tell the truth .</seg>
<seg id=1040>recently , silent changes are taking place in japan 's mainstream media reports on china 's economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1041>opposite to the previous " china threat theory " , many reports in japan have begun to believe that china 's economic development has accelerated japan 's economic recovery and a strong demand in the chinese markets has become a great driving force of japan 's economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1042>the us " newsweek " has also carried an article recently , saying that the rise of china was an opportunity instead of a threat to other countries , its neighboring countries in particular .</seg>
<seg id=1043>the widespread " china threat theory " is being replaced by the " china opportunity theory " .</seg>
<seg id=1044>the " china threat theory " claimed that china 's development would pose threats to other countries , especially its neighbors .</seg>
<seg id=1045>however , the allegation with the aim of provocation has not been accepted by china 's neighboring countries .</seg>
<seg id=1046>former malaysian prime minister mahathir once said frankly that " there is no need for asian countries to be afraid of china 's increasingly strengthened military and economic power because china does not have a tradition of invading foreign countries . "</seg>
<seg id=1047>a prospect plan issued by the indian defense ministry also believed that china posed no military threats to india .</seg>
<seg id=1048>in the area of economy and trade , various governments and enterprises have regarded china the best choice for them to expand their markets . overseas investors with strategic visions have used their actions to write the " china opportunity theory " . among the world 's top 500 enterprises , more than 400 have made investments in china .</seg>
<seg id=1049>china has been leading the world in attracting foreign investment for several years in a row .</seg>
<seg id=1050>gdp is a key macro economic indicator widely used in the world .</seg>
<seg id=1051>it is important to keep the growth of gdp during our country 's modernization drive .</seg>
<seg id=1052>we need to keep a fast economic growth momentum when taking consideration the fact alone that one percentage increase in gdp will result in more than 800,000 additional jobs .</seg>
<seg id=1053>to realize the great target of the full construction of a better - off society and the third - stage strategic goal in the modernization drive will , to a great extent , depend on a fast and sustainable growth of gdp .</seg>
<seg id=1054>however , we should notice that the gdp indicator has its defects .</seg>
<seg id=1055>for example , it is not easy to correctly reflect the quality and structure of economic growth and the level of people 's actual social welfare benefits . it also cannot correctly measure social distribution and justice .</seg>
<seg id=1056>on the other hand , gdp is also not the sole measurement .</seg>
<seg id=1057>when we review political achievements , we will not look at the gdp growth alone , instead we will also check out such aspects as people 's actual material and cultural life , the employment situation , social insurance , social justice , social order , social management and social harmony .</seg>
<seg id=1058>therefore , we should look at the gdp calculation system in a scientific spirit and with scientific attitudes and views . gdp 's position in the overall economic and social development should be properly treated .</seg>
<seg id=1059>while it is necessary to keep a certain growth rate , we shall not lay too much emphasis on or unduly or painstakingly pursue growth rate .</seg>
<seg id=1060>since the visit of a security council delegation to six countries in west africa at the end of last june , inspiring changes have taken place in the overall situation in the region in spite of ups and downs in the situation in a small number of countries .</seg>
<seg id=1061>we are pleased to notice that the government troops in sierra leone are making positive progress in improving the army and the police 's capability , strengthening the control of the country 's diamond and preparing for local government elections . the un mission in sierra leone is also phasing out in accordance with plans set earlier .</seg>
<seg id=1062>it 's also pleasing that with the deployment of the un mission in liberia , liberia is gradually getting out the shadow following a long - standing war and is on a track of reconstruction .</seg>
<seg id=1063>the political process in guinea - bissau has also made positive progress . the transitional government has promised to hold legislative election in march this year .</seg>
<seg id=1064>after suffering some setbacks , the peace process in ivory coast has seen a turn for the better . all parties have promised to implement the linas - marcoussis agreement . the " new forces " has announced to return to the national reconciliation government . the security council is discussing the issue of sending peacekeepers to the country .</seg>
<seg id=1065>we are expecting the security council to make a decision at an earlier possible date .</seg>
<seg id=1066>the secretariat , the economic community of west african states and parties concerned , from a regional perspective , are also making great efforts to settle the issues concerning small weapons , mercenaries , child soldiers and cross border .</seg>
<seg id=1067>while fully affirming the above - mentioned progress , we should also note that the overall situation in west africa is still weak . due to geographic and historical reasons in particular , the countries in this region are closely connected , with the situation in one country having influence on another . chaos in one country can usually spread to neighboring countries or even the entire region .</seg>
<seg id=1068>therefore , as what the security council has suggested , the international community , including the security council , must stick to an comprehensive and overall strategy to deal with the issues in west africa and make great efforts to settle the cross - border issues while taking active actions to help the relevant countries and regional and sub-regional organizations including the african union and the economic community of west african states to strengthen their capability of preventing and settling conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1069>we have common understanding that children are the future of the world .</seg>
<seg id=1070>we are obliged to create the best and the most suitable conditions for them to live , study , grow up and achieve success .</seg>
<seg id=1071>however , it is regrettable that in today 's world , thousands of millions of children are still suffering from armed conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1072>what they experience are chaos and backwardness . what they see are violence and destruction . what they suffer are harms and abuse . what they feel are grief and helplessness .</seg>
<seg id=1073>therefore , it is the international community 's responsibility to protect the children from harms resulted from armed conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1074>every country , especially parties involved in conflicts , should make their greatest efforts to this end .</seg>
<seg id=1075>we are pleased to see that the un has taken a series of measures to promote the protection of children in conflicts in recent years and has achieved positive results .</seg>
<seg id=1076>the security council has passed four resolutions numbered 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) , 1379 ( 2001 ) and 1460 ( 2003 ) to provide an important framework for protecting children .</seg>
<seg id=1077>the un peacekeeping forces in some regions have regarded the protection of children as one of their priorities . this includes the designation of child protection consultants . they have taken full consideration of the children 's needs while helping the countries with the programs of disarmament , demobilization and reintegration .</seg>
<seg id=1078>some peace agreements pushed forward by the un or with un 's involvement also contain articles for child protection .</seg>
<seg id=1079>national reconciliation is an important condition for establishing long - term peace and stability in post-conflict regions .</seg>
<seg id=1080>after the end of a conflict , if the parties concerned cannot be reconciled with one another or fail to put an end to their feud , a peaceful situation cannot be truly maintained and the flames of conflicts may be rekindled .</seg>
<seg id=1081>in many cases , national reconciliation following clashes requires the concerted efforts of all parties concerned . it also needs the support and help from the international community , especially the un .</seg>
<seg id=1082>for years , the un has played a useful role in helping and promoting the national reconciliation process following conflicts in some countries and has gained a lot of experience . we believe that generally speaking , the un must cope with the following three relationships in an effort to successfully help realize national reconciliation in post-conflict countries .</seg>
<seg id=1083>to give consideration to the relationship of both the short - term and long - term objectives .</seg>
<seg id=1084>national reconciliation usually needs a certain process and is hard to fulfill in just one step .</seg>
<seg id=1085>there should be different focuses in different phases .</seg>
<seg id=1086>to promote the national reconciliation , all former combatants should first be requested to " say goodbye " to their arms to create a secure environment .</seg>
<seg id=1087>during this phase , it is very important to make efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate the former combatants .</seg>
<seg id=1088>we are pleased to notice that the situation in bosnia and herzegovina is stabilizing , the relationship between different ethnic groups is easing up , the economic reconstruction has begun to achieve fruitful results , the work of refugee repatriation has almost been accomplished and its ties with neighboring countries are steadily improving .</seg>
<seg id=1089>it has not been easy for the peace process in bosnia and herzegovina to make such progress , which is very pleasing .</seg>
<seg id=1090>i 'd like to congratulate the government and the people of bosnia and herzegovina and express my heartfelt hope that all parties in bosnia and herzegovina will continue to make efforts and strengthen mutual trust and cooperation and push forward the peace process .</seg>
<seg id=1091>meanwhile , we 've also noticed that bosnia and herzegovina 's national agencies and their capabilities still need to be improved . reforms in the areas of justice and police , in particular , still face challenges .</seg>
<seg id=1092>we believe that it is proper for the high - ranking representative to make it a prior task for the first half of this year . we support the government of bosnia and herzegovina 's active cooperation with the work of the high - ranking representative .</seg>
<seg id=1093>we believe that with the help of the international community , the people of bosnia and herzegovina will continuously make new achievements in the drive of building their country and will take the road of independent development in an early date and reach the target of participating in the european integration .</seg>
<seg id=1094>the peace and stability in bosnia and herzegovina are of great significance to the realization of a long - term peace and development in this region .</seg>
<seg id=1095>the chinese side has been paying close attention to the development of the situation in bosnia and herzegovina and will join hands with the international community to make its own contributions to helping bosnia and herzegovina to realize long - term peace and economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1096>china appreciates the efforts made by the anti-terrorism committee in promoting the implementation of resolution no . 1373 ( 2001 ) in various countries and helping the developing countries to strengthen their anti-terrorism capability , and supports the anti-terrorism committee in strengthening coordination and cooperation with relevant international , regional and sub-regional organizations .</seg>
<seg id=1097>meanwhile , we hope the anti-terrorism committee will strengthen its work on anti-terrorism assistance and try to satisfy the actual needs of the developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=1098>currently , the issue of promoting the anti-terrorism committee has attracted much attention from many member states .</seg>
<seg id=1099>following rounds of negotiations , the anti-terrorism committee has raised a formal report and has had it circulated as a security council document .</seg>
<seg id=1100>following two years of practice , the current structure and operational mode of the anti-terrorism committee have appeared defective . for example , the member states have too much of a reporting burden ; there are a lot of meetings and documents ; work efficiency needs further improvement ; and there is a lack of sufficient coordination among experts .</seg>
<seg id=1101>therefore , we fully support necessary reforms of the anti-terrorism committee . we support a package of schemes proposed in the report , including the establishment of the executive council of the anti-terrorism committee . we also hope that the existing problems will be settled as soon as possible , especially the issue of heavy reporting burden on its member states .</seg>
<seg id=1102>here , what i 'd like to stress is that promotion and reform are a continuous process . no matter how reforms are carried out , the anti-terrorism committee should offer policy guidelines to the executive council . all decisions should be made by consultation and mutual agreement at the general session of the anti-terrorism committee .</seg>
<seg id=1103>in recent years , the issue of small arms has always been a focus of close attention from the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1104>this shows that all parties have increasingly realized that the excessive accumulation and illegal sales of small arms will do harms to the stability , post-war reconstruction and social development in relevant regions and countries .</seg>
<seg id=1105>it 's great relief that the un has taken a series of effective actions to deal with the problem .</seg>

<seg id=1367>to make way for a company in baoji city to build a factory on the historical site , the archaeological research institute of shaanxi province carried out archaeological excavation work on the site . a total of 31 tombs dated back to western zhou dynasty and the spring and autumn period were discovered in an area of nearly 20,000 square meters , which would soon be taken over for use .</seg>

<seg id=1573>several months before , the gas pipeline spurting accident in chongqing , the gas explosions in several coal mines and the frequent serious traffic accidents had already killed hundreds of people .</seg>
<seg id=1574>china covers a large area and has a dense population . the chances of tragedies are more than other countries . it is quite common that dozens or hundreds of people die in accidents , which is an objective and helpless reality .</seg>
<seg id=1575>however , in the perspective of common sense , the occurrence of fatal accidents in china is still too frequent .</seg>
<seg id=1576>among the numerous tragedies , fires , coal mine explosions , firework factory explosions and traffic accidents top the list .</seg>
<seg id=1577>this at least shows that the most lax measures have been adopted in these areas and people have n't learnt from previous tragedies , resulting in reoccurrence of the same kind of accidents .</seg>
<seg id=1578>in the past when singapore was undergoing fast economic growth , there also occurred serious fire accidents . the painful memory still lingers around today .</seg>
<seg id=1579>china is now within the same special period that sees fast economic growth and social transformation .</seg>
<seg id=1580>the accidents of local foreign housemaids ' falling down buildings are heard occasionally . although the number is not high in proportion but taking into consideration of the relatively safe environment for housemaids , the frequent fall - down accidents do n't conform to the job 's low casualty feature .</seg>
<seg id=1581>according to statistics , from january 1999 to june 2003 , a total of 99 housemaids of various nationalities died after accidentally falling down from buildings .</seg>
<seg id=1582>behind these numbers are many broken families that will never see their daughters and mothers back and one after another tragedy that should have been avoided . this also shows us the direction toward which we must do our best to reduce the tragic numbers to the lowest .</seg>
<seg id=1583>according to a recent statement issued by the indonesian embassy , since 1999 , 96 indonesian housemaids have died while working in singapore , some of whom died after falling down from high - rise buildings .</seg>
<seg id=1584>in response to housemaids ' fall - down accidents , the indonesian government has expressed their dissatisfaction occasionally and has made new regulations several times to strictly control the quality of local indonesian housemaids in order to ensure their safety . however , the issue has not been settled . bilateral relations between singapore and indonesia have been troubled inevitably by the issue of housemaids .</seg>
<seg id=1585>what confuses people most is that the number of housemaids ' fall - down accidents is even higher than the death toll of foreign workers in construction sites , which cannot but arouse people 's deep thoughts . and it is necessary to explore the background and the cause .</seg>
<seg id=1586>chen kongli , the world renowned taiwan issue expert from the chinese mainland , has recently published a new book , " observing taiwan " .</seg>
<seg id=1587>most of the articles in the book were written during the period from taiwan 's first party rotation in march 2000 to chen shui - bian 's proposing the theory of " one state in each side " . it is the writer 's observation and thoughts about taiwan 's internal situation and the cross - strait relations during the period of " listening to its words and watching its actions " .</seg>
<seg id=1588>the book written two years ago was finally published two years later , which shows that the censor process of thesis concerning taiwan is very complicated and very long in the mainland , and also shows that the publication of " observing taiwan " did not come out easily .</seg>
<seg id=1589>for a long time , when observing and studying the taiwan issue , chen kongku has been seeking the truth and very pragmatic , not bound by political restrictions and has been exploring the preeminent truth and deep insight .</seg>
<seg id=1590>after reading this book , this feature will leave people deeper impression .</seg>
<seg id=1591>since the early 1980s in the last century , the research on taiwan issue has become the mainland 's " major study " . many research institutions have sprung up with various kinds of scholars and experts emerging and showing their talents .</seg>
<seg id=1592>overseas people have generally divided mainland 's taiwan research agencies into the north and the south branches .</seg>
<seg id=1593>the north branch 's stance is relatively close to the government with tough opinions . it appeared more hawkish during certain historical periods or in the development course of some important political incidents .</seg>
<seg id=1594>the south branch of taiwan research institutions is generally distributed south of the yangtze river , including places such as shanghai and fujian .</seg>
<seg id=1595>japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi has been reported by the japanese media as telling lies about his " academic credential " of " studying in london for two years " .</seg>
<seg id=1596>japan 's " post weekly " has received confirmation from the dean 's office of london university that during his 9 - month stay in london , koizumi only attended several courses irregularly and did n't get any degree .</seg>
<seg id=1597>the scandal has been widely reported in the chinese media and has afforded general satisfaction .</seg>
<seg id=1598>indeed , a head of state would go so far as to fabricate the academic credential to deceive his own people .</seg>
<seg id=1599>this is especially shameful because it happened in the " imperialist " japan .</seg>
<seg id=1600>however , if we look from another perspective , we may also see some positives from the scandal .</seg>
<seg id=1601>in addition , this is exactly what we lack and what we need to improve .</seg>
<seg id=1602>we have been advocating " integrity " in recent years to " build a sunshine government " , to respect the public 's " information rights " and to improve the administrative " transparency " . however , the reality is far from the aspiration .</seg>
<seg id=1603>think about it . a " fake " academic credential of a country 's prime minister is , in fact , not something very big , but it was exposed by the media and fiercely attacked .</seg>
<seg id=1604>in such a country , what else cannot be put under the " sunshine " ?</seg>
<seg id=1605>at taiwan 's electoral promotion parties , all groups will use buses to move the masses to the sites . however , the recent situation is the parties of bian - lu are obviously more desolate than those of lian - song .</seg>
<seg id=1606>not long ago , at a promotion party in somewhere in the north , when taiwan president chen shui - bian shouted loudly " dongsuan ( elected ) " , half of the participants did n't follow him unexpectedly . it turned out later that many of the local people have relatives or friends who are making investments in the mainland . the continuous postponement of the three direct links and the poor performance of the financial policies have upset many people .</seg>
<seg id=1607>if nothing unexpected happens , in the countdown of taiwan 's presidential election , the pair of chen - lu is presumed to be defeated , as signs in the public polls and underground gambles have shown .</seg>
<seg id=1608>unless more exciting scenarios appear , for example , the pan-blue camp is split or more embarrassing scandals come out , chen shui - bian , who overtook the power with the support of lee teng - hui , has already proved that he has failed to win people 's hearts over the past four years and has weakened his supporters ' confidence following the green camp 's various financial scandals and low taste roles and performances being exposed to the public .</seg>
<seg id=1609>facing the blue camp , who is likely to resume the ruling power , how should beijing look at the issue ?</seg>
<seg id=1610>the first thing that should be understood is the blue camp , which is likely to take over power again , is already not the nationalist party but a combination of the blue and the orange , and the issue is whether the traditional party will join hands with the local party .</seg>
<seg id=1611>the close cooperation during the election campaign cannot be seen as a logical relationship in the future .</seg>
<seg id=1612>if there is a hope of being elected , it will spend a lot of time to make internal restructuring . the following legislative election at the end of the year will also prevent the lian - song administration from making too great changes in the cross - strait relations .</seg>
<seg id=1613>unless it realizes that the improvement of cross - strait ties will add points to taiwan 's internal politics and it is confident that it will make achievements in a short period of time . and the most important thing is to let the mass public to see the achievement .</seg>
<seg id=1614>under such circumstances , beijing should slow down its moves to promote the unification and give more time to lian - song , a pair of " traditional blue camp " leaders , to consolidate their internal situation .</seg>
<seg id=1615>over half a century has passed since the us carried out its first nuclear explosion in new mexico in july 1945 and dropped two nuclear bombs in japan in august the same year .</seg>
<seg id=1616>although nuclear weapons accumulated during the armament race of the us and the soviet union are enough to destruct the whole world , it is a relief that both sides had realized the danger of nuclear wars and prevented from pressing the nuclear buttons .</seg>
<seg id=1617>since the dissolution of the soviet union , the world has entered the era of post-cold war . the danger of large - scale nuclear wars has basically been eliminated .</seg>
<seg id=1618>but at the same time , the danger of nuclear proliferation has not decreased but increased instead .</seg>
<seg id=1619>this kind of proliferation shows up in two areas .</seg>
<seg id=1620>the first is that some medium or larger - sized countries with substantial resources and strength are seeking various ways to produce and own nuclear weapons in an effort to gain domination in a region , resist neighboring countries , safeguard security or carry out blackmail diplomacy .</seg>
<seg id=1621>the second is that some non-state organizations , especially the islamic extremist groups that harbor strong hatred against the western world , are doing their best to seek small nuclear weapons to launch bloody terrorist attacks against the west at the cost of a large number of innocent people .</seg>
<seg id=1622>with this kind of demand , middlemen , who are engaged in relevant technological transfer and sales , and the " nuclear black markets " have come into being . with their scales getting increasingly larger , they have become one of the important components of the proliferation in today 's world .</seg>
<seg id=1623>as one of the descendants of the chinese people living in the hangzhou - jiaxing - huzhou area , the past scenes of the countryside and farmers ' life south of the yangtze river are still in my memory now .</seg>
<seg id=1624>when returning home after years of departure , i found the green fields along the hu - hang expressway were dotted with three - story buildings built by the farmers themselves , but few people were working in the fields .</seg>
<seg id=1625>it surprised me very much that such great changes have taken place in my homeland and with my fellow countrymen .</seg>
<seg id=1626>however , i was shocked recently to see some reportage and experts ' on - the - spot investigations regarding the situation in china 's rural areas on the internet .</seg>
<seg id=1627>it 's hard to believe that such unimaginable dark sides still exist in china 's rural areas and the chinese farmers are still living such humiliated and hard lives without any rights .</seg>
<seg id=1628>the lengthy " china rural area investigation " , written by chen guili and his wife after they conducted on - the - spot investigations in rural areas in anhui , henan and hebei provinces , has spoken out for the farmers and has shocked the chinese society .</seg>
<seg id=1629>they have drawn a conclusion from a large number of facts that farmers are squeezed or even killed by corrupt officials : " getting closer to the chinese farmers , we have felt unprecedented shock and grievance . we have seen poverty , sins , helplessness , resistance , silence and grief that one can hardly imagine " .</seg>
<seg id=1630>these are really the most touching words .</seg>
<seg id=1631>as expected , malaysian prime minister abdullah announced the dissolution of the parliament the day before yesterday . a new election will be held in the near future .</seg>
<seg id=1632>to abdullah , the election is of great importance in his political career while it has the same symbolic meaning to malaysia 's political situation and its development .</seg>
<seg id=1633>it has only been four months since abdullah took over from mahathir last november .</seg>
<seg id=1634>despite of this , he still decided to dissolve the parliament and hold an earlier election .</seg>
<seg id=1635>this , at least , has two implications : firstly , abdullah has been satisfied with his administrative performance over the past four months and has much confidence in the voters ' intentions ; secondly , he expects to consolidate his power basis through this way to shake off the shadow left by mahathir .</seg>
<seg id=1636>there is no doubt that abdullah 's decision to hold a blitz election has shown that he has made an overall appraisal of the domestic political situation .</seg>
<seg id=1637>malaysia is seeing a good economic performance now and there are no topics for the opposition parties to make use of .</seg>
<seg id=1638>in addition to this , since abdullah came into office , he has taken some very transparent anti-graft measures , including the arrest and prosecution of former lands and cooperative development minister kasitah gaddam , which has been welcomed and aroused the public optimism about future anti-corruption operations .</seg>
<seg id=1639>meanwhile , he has called to improve the efficiency of public services , which is also an inspiring move .</seg>
<seg id=1640>since the first day of its birth , the eu 's growth and the formation of its patterns have been greatly influenced by france 's politics and culture .</seg>
<seg id=1641>it is the eu 's foreign policy direction to struggle for independence in diplomacy and to seek attitudes and ways to deal with world affairs different from the us , from which the influence of france can be seen .</seg>
<seg id=1642>it is because of this that the international community , including china , russia and arab countries , all expect to see the eu to rise as a completely independent force in international relations .</seg>
<seg id=1643>we must admit that since late 1980s , the eu has been moving towards this direction in diplomacy .</seg>
<seg id=1644>in december 1992 , all eu heads of states agreed during the maastricht summit that all member states would adopt a unified foreign policy and speak in one voice .</seg>
<seg id=1645>however , two years later , the so - called " unified foreign policy " saw a complete failure for the first time in dealing with the issue of bosnia .</seg>
<seg id=1646>from the maastricht summit till today , the 10 - year - old eu foreign policy has little to show off .</seg>
<seg id=1647>it is even worse that the eu 's foreign policy has completely failed to pass the test of big events .</seg>
<seg id=1648>the member states ' different views on the us war in iraq has demonstrated this and has once again exposed its deadly political defect . that is it can be easily divided and defeated by other big powers .</seg>
<seg id=1649>on february 24 , president bush announced that he would support a constitution amendment of banning homosexual marriage .</seg>
<seg id=1650>this is an obvious turn from his ambiguous attitude toward the issue in several months and represents an important political development in the us election year .</seg>
<seg id=1651>the constitution amendment banning homosexual marriage is a very powerful political weapon in southern us , which is a newly emerging base of the republican party . but it also has very negative effect because it is a cultural dispute that can split the public opinion all around the us , which is likely to aggravate us political polarization and further alienate the eastern and western costal areas dominated by the liberals .</seg>
<seg id=1652>it is obvious that bush 's deeds have gone against his words as he claimed to be a " unifier " instead of a " splitter " during the 2000 election campaign .</seg>
<seg id=1653>in addition , the american younger generation has become more and more open on the issue of homosexual marriage . bush 's move will have short - term effect but will do harm to the republican party 's long - term interests .</seg>
<seg id=1654>bush 's new constitution amendment campaign can be seen as a " scorched earth policy " in this year 's presidential election .</seg>
<seg id=1655>bush has adopted this policy because he has been increasingly troubled by the two topics of " anti-terrorism " and economy - employment and has to open new battlefields on topics of religions and cultures to split the public opinion .</seg>
<seg id=1656>the united states has so far taken a cautious attitude .</seg>
<seg id=1657>in other words , since maintaining taiwan straits ' status quo is in the interests of the us long - term objective of containing the mainland , the us is trying to avoid political and military clashes with china as a result of encouraging taiwan independence .</seg>
<seg id=1658>it is predictable that the us is unable to completely eliminate the room for taiwan to hold a referendum as requested by beijing , but considering its own interests it will take some moves of early warning .</seg>
<seg id=1659>recently , us secretary of state powell has taken the initiative to reiterate the taiwan policy set before to show us opposition to taiwan independence .</seg>
<seg id=1660>these remarks are seen to prevent chen shui - bian from taking extremist actions .</seg>
<seg id=1661>the recent remarks made by some us intelligence individuals with government backgrounds and a large number of espionage ships sent by the us to the taiwan straits to conduct reconnaissance on the cross - strait military movement all have indirectly demonstrated that the us is closely watching the situation across the taiwan strait .</seg>
<seg id=1662>it has shown from another perspective that although the us will not prevent taiwan from holding the referendum as requested by beijing , it is likewise concerned about the uncertainties existing in the situation of the taiwan strait .</seg>
<seg id=1663>any large - scale and one to one election will eventually have one result , which is either chen shui - bian narrowly wins the re-election or lian chan reenters taiwan 's presidential palace .</seg>
<seg id=1664>what worries people most is that under the circumstance of the imbalance of information dissemination , personages of various circles in the mainland have not seemed to be prepared for the possibility that chen shui - bian is still likely to win .</seg>
<seg id=1665>if the election result is not what has been expected , beijing will , once again , fall into an unnecessary and passive position .</seg>
<seg id=1666>an old arabian saying goes like this : " one day of chaos is more fearful than a thousand years of tyranny . "</seg>
<seg id=1667>is this what currently worries northeastern asian countries ?</seg>
<seg id=1668>i think the answer is perhaps affirmative .</seg>
<seg id=1669>a research and development center , which is close to washington and sponsored by the us government , has discussed four policy options in a study to deal with north korea 's nuclear crisis , namely exchanges , containment , economic sanctions and preemptive strike operations .</seg>
<seg id=1670>the attitudes of the regional countries towards these policies are the focus of this investigation .</seg>
<seg id=1671>in addition , the investigation also analyzes the threats posed by north korea 's nuclear weapon program on the basis of people 's opinions about the possibility of a nuclear attack and its possible damages as well as their fears in north korea 's neighboring countries .</seg>
<seg id=1672>china and russia believe that there is little or very little possibility that north korea will use nuclear weapons while people in japan and south korea think there is a great threat .</seg>
<seg id=1673>all the northeastern asian countries support maintaining exchanges with north korea .</seg>
<seg id=1674>japan supports containment . other countries also believe that under certain circumstance , the policy of containment is acceptable .</seg>
<seg id=1675>singapore cares very much about its international rankings and pays much attention to various lists of national standings presented by european and us agencies all year round .</seg>
<seg id=1676>being on the top of the lists frequently has naturally increased our interests in standings .</seg>
<seg id=1677>however , there is lots of annoyance about topping the standings on everything .</seg>
<seg id=1678>ordinary citizens believe that too much concern about the standings has demonstrated the fear of being defeated while too much emphasis on our own standings shows the arrogance .</seg>
<seg id=1679>so people say we should live an easier life and we 'd better stand aloof from worldly strife .</seg>
<seg id=1680>since many people seemed to distain the standings in the past very much , there has been an interesting phenomenon that people seem to no longer regard " topping the world " as a good news , instead they tended to regard it as an embarrassment .</seg>
<seg id=1681>however , things have changed over the past one or two years .</seg>
<seg id=1682>we have cast doubts on the country 's long - term competitiveness . all walks of life are also worried about the loss of their jobs .</seg>
<seg id=1683>having such doubts , we no longer talk with ease .</seg>
<seg id=1684>the international competition remains fierce . excessive ease will allow others to overtake you . it is also easy to go from leading in everything to lagging behind in everything .</seg>
<seg id=1685>on the surface , it appears that bush is very loyal to cheney . at the republican party 's governors congress last month , bush promised that cheney would be the only vice presidential candidate .</seg>
<seg id=1686>but he half jokingly said that he had entrusted cheney to look for a vice presidential candidate for him just like in 2000 .</seg>
<seg id=1687>cheney , who has long been keeping a low profile , has also been frequently interviewed by the media recently , denying that he would be replaced .</seg>
<seg id=1688>however , he has also prepared himself an out .</seg>
<seg id=1689>he said that he would retreat from difficulties if there was a health problem or if he felt he would become a real burden for the president .</seg>
<seg id=1690>cheney is 63 years old and has suffered four heart attacks .</seg>
<seg id=1691>it is widely reported that the us army has , in fact , surrounded osama and will capture him once the time is ripe .</seg>
<seg id=1692>the presidential electoral voting will begin on november 2 . it is said that the pentagon had arranged a good play of the capture of osama in october .</seg>
<seg id=1693>however , a long delay means more uncertainties . if osama succeeds in fleeing away , many troubles will come up in the future .</seg>
<seg id=1694>it seems that giuliani can truly be regarded as a safe trump card for bush to win the votes .</seg>
<seg id=1695>the two rivals in the 2004 us presidential election have been affirmed : democratic candidate kerry will challenge the republican incumbent president bush .</seg>
<seg id=1696>they will begin promotion , debates and other " warm - up campaigns " before the november election .</seg>
<seg id=1697>they will be likely to debate with words and articles on the three topics of war , economy and society .</seg>
<seg id=1698>bush believes that war is closely linked to the us national security ; the war against saddam and anti-terrorism are to ensure america 's security , so he tells the americans : " we are in a war . "</seg>
<seg id=1699>kerry will naturally find faults with bush that he has abused the faulty intelligence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction to launch the war against iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1700>as to the economy , kerry believes that bush 's tax cut - off plan is in the interests of the rich and cannot create new job opportunities .</seg>
<seg id=1701>bush will show kerry : are n't the us economic indexes going up ?</seg>
<seg id=1702>in terms of social issues , take the relationship between man and woman for example , bush opposes homosexual marriage , abortions and supports the death penalty ; kerry also opposes homosexual marriage but supports abortions and opposes the death penalty .</seg>
<seg id=1703>how will bush and kerry express their views on the three big issues and convince the voters through advertisements , tv and speeches will be political shows to be staged in the coming eight months .</seg>
<seg id=1704>however , in terms of diplomacy , kerry has a larger room to perform .</seg>
<seg id=1705>according to statistics , young people who commit suicide are mostly aged between 15 and 19 , but there are still some aged between 10 and 14 .</seg>
<seg id=1706>generally speaking , academic pressure is a cause of young people 's suicide . however , research found that emotional problems , especially the love affairs between man and woman and the relationship with their parents , are the main causes of young people 's suicide .</seg>
<seg id=1707>academic pressure and failing to meet expectations are certainly topics that parents and children should communicate with each other .</seg>
<seg id=1708>academic pressure is an inevitable burden for local students . the pressure sometimes comes from themselves but in many occasions , it is imposed on the children by their parents .</seg>
<seg id=1709>parents have high expectation for their children 's good academic performance and often compare them with other children , requiring them to try to become the top students , which will certainly bring much pressure . however , the communication channels behind the pressure are the real thermometer to measure the intimate relationship between parents and their children .</seg>
<seg id=1710>if a child 's performance is below expectation , their parents ' beating and scolding or straightening their faces as a silent blame , or even making the child feel he / she is disappointing will undoubtedly push the child into a helpless and desperate position .</seg>
<seg id=1711>it is reported that many young students who need guidance are forced by their parents ' high expectation to a desperate position and get psychological troubles .</seg>
<seg id=1712>singapore 's success and rapid development have made parents feel that their children 's current material condition is much better than that of their own in the past , so they cannot help believing that their children should perform better than they did .</seg>
<seg id=1713>in many occasions , parents have forgotten the fact that when they were in their childhood , their performances in various fields might not be , in fact , very excellent , either .</seg>
<seg id=1714>at the age of one and a half year old , most children will be sent to nurseries for a full - time child - care in various department units . the authorities will symbolically charge a little for the child - care . children go back home once every week or even every month .</seg>
<seg id=1715>today , singapore faces the social problems of a decreasing birth rate and an aging population .</seg>
<seg id=1716>the younger generation is unable even to fend for themselves to maintain a modern living standard and fashionable material comforts , how can they have the energy to follow the government 's call for early marriage and early childbirth .</seg>
<seg id=1717>the writer has a bold suggestion : the government takes the responsibility to raise newly born children .</seg>
<seg id=1718>the citizens are only responsible for giving births and will not have to care about the issue of raising children .</seg>
<seg id=1719>on one hand , the government opens full - time boarding nurseries and kindergartens and converts primary schools to full - time operations , or even provides three meals and symbolically charges the citizens what they can afford .</seg>
<seg id=1720>this not only helps to settle the problem of unemployment , but also will free the government from worries over whether such measures as offering baby bonds , prolonging maternity leave , raising the quality of housemaids and offering tax rebates are effective or not .</seg>
<seg id=1721>what beijing needs to do is not only to act as a host of the six - party talks , but also keeps in mind china 's long - term interests in the korean peninsular to prepare for the worst and carry out strategic plans as early as possible .</seg>
<seg id=1722>in specific , beijing should , on one hand , urge north korea to give up its nuclear arms , and on the other hand , it should begin with reforming kim jong il 's regime to lead it to a modern road in order to eliminate the danger of a nuclear war in northeastern asia , to maintain the status quo of the korean peninsular and to gain a strategic bargaining counter in dealing with the us in the long run .</seg>
<seg id=1723>pyongyang is fierce of mien but faint of heart and is eager to develop its economy and get integrated into the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1724>however , this aspiration is often expressed through a tough and irrational extrinsic form , which sometimes completely goes against international rules .</seg>
<seg id=1725>in fact , for a long time , beijing has been making use of its influence and economic means to force pyongyang to change its stance which goes against the international rules .</seg>
<seg id=1726>however , such action still needs to be fully planned .</seg>
<seg id=1727>beijing 's assistance to pyongyang should not be restricted to the economic area and should be expanded to other social areas . it should not be only focused on pyongyang 's abandonment of nuclear programs , instead it should focus on leading the country to a road of modern civilization .</seg>
<seg id=1728>when kerry first entered the arena , nobody expected him to win . at that time , all the attention was focused on former vermont governor dean .</seg>
<seg id=1729>however , in january , before the party 's congress was held in iowa , kerry suddenly emerged and won the party 's congress and the preliminary elections in the two most important states , iowa and new hampshire .</seg>
<seg id=1730>in the following preliminary elections in various states , kerry seldom lost . his only losses came in states where they had their own candidates .</seg>
<seg id=1731>it only took kerry six weeks to develop from a candidate with little prospect to the final candidate . all his rivals , including gephardt , lieberman , clark , dean and edwards failed one by one . this has made people to look at his political charm with new eyes .</seg>
<seg id=1732>being a senator for 19 years , kerry has been supporting abortion and environmental protection policies . he opposes the tax reduction plan that is in the interests of the rich , dedicated to increasing the minimum wages and expects to settle the problem of global warming .</seg>
<seg id=1733>his working experience in washington d . c . has demonstrated his willingness to face tough social issues , his courage of challenging the authority and seeking values as well as his fearlessness of impairing some people 's interests .</seg>
<seg id=1734>china 's reform and opening up policy began in the agricultural sector . rural residents were the earliest beneficiaries of the policy .</seg>
<seg id=1735>however , since the 1990s , the economic policies have given more attention to urban areas , bringing the agricultural reforms to a standstill and resulting in an increasing gap between the urban and rural areas .</seg>
<seg id=1736>with the lapse of time , two completely different worlds have appeared in china . one is the highly prosperous urban area and the other is the poor and backward countryside .</seg>
<seg id=1737>quoting an official comment from china , the enlarging gap between china 's urban and rural areas is " a problem during the course of development " and will only be settled by sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1738>in other words , china 's costal areas and urban areas should continue to develop instead of being burdened by the problems in rural areas .</seg>
<seg id=1739>however , when some big cities see a small change in one year and a big change in three years , people cannot help asking why no changes have taken place in some poor areas over the past 10 years .</seg>
<seg id=1740>of course , the way of development is different in urban and rural areas , which is a fact that should be admitted . however , the problem is when a large amount of money is invested in the urban construction and to encourage and support the wealthy middle - class , whether the rural population , which holds 70% of the country 's total population , is also being concerned about and has been given much attention to ?</seg>
<seg id=1741>in theory , all previous chinese governments have paid great attention to the issues concerning agriculture , rural areas and farmers .</seg>
<seg id=1742>however , over the past few years , the situation in the rural areas has deteriorated , which demonstrates that the degree of attention is becoming increasingly inadequate .</seg>
<seg id=1743>in any country , the public security organs , procuratorial organs and people 's courts are supposed to be the symbol of justice and fairness and also are important systems to safeguard social stability .</seg>
<seg id=1744>unfortunately , the public security organs , procuratorial organs and people 's courts have become a symbol of corruption in china .</seg>
<seg id=1745>a recent report issued by the national audit administration said an investigation of the financial affairs of police departments in 26 provinces and cities showed that a total of 16.5 billion yuan had been abused by police departments around the country in violation of rules .</seg>
<seg id=1746>the confidence crisis in the public security organs , procuratorial organs and people 's courts has come out into the open .</seg>
<seg id=1747>the incidents of liu yong and sun zhigang and the recent " bmw " incident in heilongjiang have all reflected such deep distrust .</seg>
<seg id=1748>the incident of " bmw " is more typical .</seg>
<seg id=1749>people have paid more attention to the issue than to the " sars " even during the period of the " sars " epidemic .</seg>
<seg id=1750>in fact , what people were paying attention to was not the " bmw " incident itself , instead they have expressed their distrust of the whole legal system .</seg>
<seg id=1751>the relevant departments were very clear about this so they ordered a blackout of the media .</seg>
<seg id=1752>however , the problem is still there .</seg>
<seg id=1753>the second round of six - party talks on the nuclear issue in the korean peninsular has come to an end as what people have generally expected .</seg>
<seg id=1754>during the talks , the parties concerned have come into contact with and sounded one another about the peripheral issues of the korean peninsula nuclear crisis and have reached common ground on issues of holding the third round of talks by the end of june this year and the establishment of a working team .</seg>
<seg id=1755>however , the talks have made not only no progress on substantial issues including how north korea should give up its nuclear research program and how the us will ensure north korea 's political and military security and provide energy resources to north korea after the country abandons the nuclear program , but also have left an impression of a more and more tightening fast knot .</seg>
<seg id=1756>the two leading roles , north korea and the us , have not made any compromise and the two sides ' basic stances are not changed .</seg>
<seg id=1757>however , what catches attention is that the us has shown an attitude that it was not eager to settle the issue and has left an impression of " dilatoriness " .</seg>
<seg id=1758>the us strategy is closely linked to the new development of the current international situation and the interests it is seeking in such new developments .</seg>
<seg id=1759>since the roosevelt administration , the us has not seen so many company bosses in prison .</seg>
<seg id=1760>is this a coincidence or the public and investors can no longer tolerate corporate crimes and other illegal acts over the past three years , leading to these crimes discovered one after another recently ?</seg>
<seg id=1761>the answer is perhaps not simple , but it is a true fact that many corporate crimes have been discovered recently .</seg>
<seg id=1762>this is a good sign for the economic recovery and for rebuilding investors ' confidence in particular .</seg>
<seg id=1763>late 1990s was probably one of the most chaotic and unpredictable periods in us business history . the earlier its influence disappears , the better .</seg>
<seg id=1764>when everything is settled , some companies ' names will definitely fade into history and will only be found in textbooks of business schools .</seg>
<seg id=1765>other companies , such as tyco and mci will , under the leadership of new management teams , try to restructure themselves to face the coming of a new round of economic growth .</seg>
<seg id=1766>when will the new round of economic growth come ?</seg>
<seg id=1767>as a ceo , you may not have an answer .</seg>
<seg id=1768>but it does n't matter , because chairman of the us federal reserve greenspan does n't have the answer either .</seg>
<seg id=1769>the bush administration expects to stimulate the economy with the help of the keynesian theory , by greatly increasing expenditures ( especially defense expenses ) on one hand , and sharply reducing taxes on the other .</seg>
<seg id=1770>in the international front , the bush administration continues to push forward free trade but the trade deficit has reached a new high of 540 billion us dollars .</seg>
<seg id=1771>after a sharp tax reduction , investment and consumption have not seen obvious increase .</seg>
<seg id=1772>the new keynesian school , represented by renowned british economist wyme godley , believes that the us economy is already in trouble .</seg>
<seg id=1773>they believe that the so - called " market law in command " is only an illusion and is surely to benefit a small number of people and do harms to most others .</seg>
<seg id=1774>people used to believe that around the world the so - called small number of beneficiaries were in the us and most people suffering losses were all in the developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=1775>however , this is not true today .</seg>
<seg id=1776>many people in the us economist circle believe that the winners of the current globalization are us - based multinational companies . in addition , india and china are also in an outstanding position .</seg>
<seg id=1777>india has occupied the service economic sector while china has dominated the manufacturing sector .</seg>
<seg id=1778>much attention has been paid to the great transfer of us funds and manufacturing equipments to china but few have come to realize the advantages of china 's high - quality and low - income labor market .</seg>
<seg id=1779>firstly , whether taiwan 's situation is within beijing 's expectation .</seg>
<seg id=1780>only beijing knows what is its prediction , but the result of the prediction can be judged from what we can see publicly .</seg>
<seg id=1781>over the past four years , the taiwan independence camp led by chen shui - bian and lu xiu - lian has had clear - cut slogans and diligent as well as nimble actions . the moves of taiwan independence have made some positive progress .</seg>
<seg id=1782>in comparison , except for occasional warnings , beijing 's attitude looks like a mere formality and seems indifferent to the development of taiwan independence .</seg>
<seg id=1783>however , since last fall , it has completely changed like an ox cart turning to a vehicle . it has been very obvious over the past few months that its ability of handling the issue is totally different from that in 1990s .</seg>
<seg id=1784>from this , we can predict that taiwan 's situation is within its prediction .</seg>
<seg id=1785>secondly , look at the diplomacy concerning taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=1786>in terms of the development of the situation across the taiwan straits , we should see whether the stances of major countries including the us are closer to beijing or to taipei .</seg>
<seg id=1787>since these countries ' stances are open , the answer is very clear .</seg>
<seg id=1788>so far , various countries have not only got closer to beijing with more exchanges and alienated from taipei with fewer exchanges , but also have begun to offer " earnest " advice to taiwan 's democracy , which has long been praised .</seg>

<seg id=1>with the advent of a new century , economic globalization has become a major and serious challenge to african countries .</seg>
<seg id=2>the leaders of african countries have realized more and more clearly that africa cannot afford to allow another opportunity to slip by and must actively seek ways to deal with the situation .</seg>
<seg id=3>on july 9 , 2002 , the african union was officially established and started operation . since then , the african countries , while actively implementing the " new partnership for africa 's development , " working hard to develop the economy and trying to get themselves out of the unfavorable situation in the economic globalization , have also been making every effort to resolve armed conflicts , the major obstacle in the rejuvenation of africa , so as to create a united , peaceful and stable environment .</seg>
<seg id=4>at present , the overall situation in africa tends to be easing off . the hot issues are obviously cooling off and all countries feel it more urgent to end the armed conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=5>with the strong support from the united nations and the international community , influential regional organizations , regional big powers and prominent politicians in africa are all taking active actions , stepping up their efforts to resolve regional conflicts and eliminate civil strife . some conflicts and turmoil that lasted for years are now basically under control .</seg>
<seg id=6>for example , a government of national unity was established in congo - kinshasa in june last year ; sao tome and principe peacefully resolved a coup crisis in july ; the liberian government and the rebel armed groups signed a peace accord in august in accra , capital of ghana ; the sudanese government and the southern rebel armed groups started the crucial talks in september that broke the stalemate in peace process ; various somali armed forces and political factions started a peace talk in kenya in october to discuss the peace process in the entire country ; and the burundi government and rebel armed groups signed a peace agreement in november and so on .</seg>
<seg id=7>of course , the current stability in africa is still relatively tenuous and the peace achievements still need to be consolidated . and some potential or existing armed conflicts are still to be finally resolved .</seg>
<seg id=8>in the meantime , the economic growth rate in african countries is still far behind those in the developing countries in asia and other regions . these are all unfavorable factors in the development of africa .</seg>
<seg id=9>how african countries can effectively cope with the challenge of economic globalization and realize the dream of african rejuvenation still needs the long - term and arduous efforts on the part of the african peoples .</seg>

<seg id=19>it was planned that during its 18 - day mission , beagle 2 would test rock , soil , signal transmission mode or all the present life forms , etc. collected from mars .</seg>

<seg id=113>( afp , washington , january 5 ) as singapore , home to the largest airport in asia , endorsed deployment of armed police on airliners to counter the terrorist threats , the unites states started the new rules today of photographing and fingerprinting foreign travelers entering the country .</seg>
<seg id=114>washington authorities tightened the check - ups on arriving foreign travelers at a time when concerns for global aviation safety are rapidly rising . in the last week , these concerns have forced the cancellation of several flights coming and returning to the united states .</seg>
<seg id=115>the new photographing and fingerprinting requirements apply only to foreign visitors who must have visas to enter the united states . this type of visitors is generally expected to reach 23 million this year .</seg>
<seg id=116>according to the department of homeland security , which is in charge of implementing us - visit program , citizens from 28 countries , mostly european nations , are exempt from the above described procedure .</seg>
<seg id=117>immigration groups criticized the program as a violation on civil liberties and as a step toward creating a surveillance society . homeland security secretary ridge aggressively defended the program .</seg>
<seg id=118>in an interview with nbc , ridge said : " one of primary responsibilities of any government is to secure its borders . it is to do this job well that we are promoting this program . i do n't think it is obtrusive ; as a matter of fact , it takes only about 15 seconds and apparently nobody seems to mind .

<seg id=467>most of the deaths from bird flu in vietnam were caused by the h5n1 virus .</seg>
<seg id=468>the spokesman said a combination of newcastle disease and type a bird flu has killed 4.7 million fowls since last november .</seg>
<seg id=469>about 60% of them died of newcastle disease .</seg>
<seg id=470>he said no order has been issued yet for an immediate culling .</seg>
<seg id=471>quoting sudarjat , indonesia 's state news agency reported that authorities have conducted tests using serums from the uk and australia to determine the strain of virus , but the results will not be available until wednesday or thursday . the government will then send the report to the relevant international organizations .</seg>
<seg id=472>snow over western and northern europe wreaks havoc to traffic and transport</seg>
<seg id=473>( afp , paris , january 29 ) blizzard has covered most of western and northern europe , disrupting traffic and railroad transport and forcing hundreds of flight cancellations in britain , germany and denmark .</seg>
<seg id=474>in london , a spokesman for heathrow airport said that last night 's snow drifts caused over 200 flight cancellations at the airport and suspended another 80 flights early this morning .</seg>
<seg id=475>gatwick and stansted , two other airports near london , are also affected by the snow drifts and a total of 18 flights have been canceled due to the weather .</seg>
<seg id=476>in germany , the wintry weather led to the cancellation of at least 60 flights to frankfurt international airport , the largest airport in the country .</seg>
<seg id=477>transport authorities said dozens of other flights to frankfurt were delayed and the air traffic may be affected by the weather for the rest of the day today .</seg>
<seg id=478>in france , restrictions on road traffic went into force in paris after an overnight snowfall , but similar measures in other parts of the country were lifted this morning .</seg>
<seg id=479>all services are reportedly back to near normal at major airports in paris . yesterday , a combination of snow and fog led to a series of delays at de gaulle airport .</seg>
<seg id=480>however , airport authorities in paris advised air travelers to check whether their flights will be on schedule before leaving home .</seg>
<seg id=481>with the exception of the mediterranean coast , most of france is covered in white snow .</seg>
<seg id=482>taiwan and japan , both being democracies , should regard it as their obligation or even as a responsibility to make joint efforts toward consolidating democracy in asia .</seg>
<seg id=483>in order to promote democratic values , the government in our country will establish the " taiwan democracy foundation " in the coming days with the cooperation of international political parties as one of its focuses .</seg>
<seg id=484>through this foundation , the democratic progress party hopes to work together with democratic parties in other countries , share its experience of promoting democracy with other countries and make its contribution to the peace , stability and prosperity in asia so that our ideal of establishing " asian democratic alliance " will be realized as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=485>in a rapidly changing world , a slightest shift in the balance of power in the region would affect the entire area , putting the security of all countries under test .</seg>
<seg id=486>in the asia pacific region , north korea , complacent about its possession of nuclear weapons , has repeatedly test - fired missiles that flew over japans airspace since the united states started the war on iraq last month . in addition , china has long been actively expanding its military arsenal and has deployed ballistic missiles aiming at taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=487>all this has posed grave threats to the security of taiwan and japan as well as the rest of asia pacific region .</seg>
<seg id=488>these issues concerning the consolidation of democracy and safeguarding of security need formal security mechanisms before they can be discussed and resolved .</seg>
<seg id=489>since today 's symposium is the first official dialogue on security between the dpp , the ruling party of taiwan , and the liberal democratic party , the ruling party of japan and parliament members of other political parties , its importance is self-evident .</seg>
<seg id=490>i myself also hope that in addition to the bilateral dialogue between taiwan and japan , the united states , japan , south korea and other neighboring countries in the asia pacific region will in the future be able to jointly promote the establishment of " security dialogue mechanism " and also support taiwans participation in the multilateral dialogue organizations in the region so as to implement the idea of " cooperative security . "</seg>
<seg id=491>this is an important moment today that encourages us to continue pushing forward with the reform . we hereby express our appreciation in acknowledgement of all the efforts by our party members in demonstrating the will of this party and their joint efforts in achieving the goals of the reform .</seg>
<seg id=492>" the withdrawal of political parties from radio and television stations " is not only the most basic requirement for the implementation of media reform but also a concept the dpp has always adhered to . that our party is in power should mean the reform will be accelerated , not that we become a hurdle or a burden to the reform .</seg>
<seg id=493>we also understand that in order to promote this goal , elected public officials in our party should take the lead in withdrawing themselves from media businesses . this will be a small step toward media reform but it will also be a crucial step .</seg>
<seg id=494>during the era of the martial law when media was monopolized , many party members , in order to gain access to open public forum , engaged themselves in such difficult tasks as establishing the fourth tv station and local radio stations , through which they hoped to break the existing restrictions and help promote the reform of the media environment .</seg>
<seg id=495>for example , comrade trong chai spent much time and energy in those days in establishing the fourth terrestrial television station and eventually founded " formosa television . "</seg>
<seg id=496>this action brought a significant impact on the entire media environment particularly in that it shattered the longtime monopoly of the three stations and provided more space for the development of cable television stations .</seg>
<seg id=497>however , we must understand that due to the historical limitation , there were many things that were done because they had to be done in the course of promoting the reform . therefore , when the media is completely open and free today , it means we have accomplished the mission set for that phase . to allow the reform to continue its course , we must make choices as to what to keep and what to sacrifice .</seg>
<seg id=498>the central standing committee declared that all elected public officials in our party should withdraw themselves completely from their media businesses by the next session of the legislative yuan , namely , september 5 , so as to set an example of fulfilling their promise to the people .</seg>
<seg id=499>we are very much pleased that all of you can give priority to the ideal and goal of the party . people like trong chai , chang chun - hung , chou ching - yu , hou shui - sheng , kao meng - ting , huang nai - hui and shen ming - kung and others , who made a great deal of contribution during the democratic movement , are all able to sacrifice their minor individual interest in favor of promoting the media reform .</seg>
<seg id=500>ruling does not mean enjoying power , but assuming more responsibilities .</seg>
<seg id=501>despite setbacks and bumpy progress it has encountered since it took power , the democratic progressive party has always managed to turn challenges into motivation for making progress and has steadily led taiwan in deepening democratization while keeping in line with universal values of global democracy , peace and prosperity .</seg>
<seg id=502>this is because it is always our belief that only people are the masters of this country , and the dpp 's duty is to elevate the party 's founding principles of " integrity , diligence and love for the homeland " to the bright vision of " reform , progress and good life , " and lay the foundation for a lasting peace and stability for 23 million taiwanese people .</seg>
<seg id=503>for a long time , the dpp has played a role of " government performing multiple functions in promoting taiwan 's diplomacy and has achieved brilliant results .</seg>
<seg id=504>despite chinas constant diplomatic pressure and military threats , we have never caved in , because we have grasped our fate in our own hands , and despite the absence of rich resources , the dpp has made small but steady progress in expanding space for taiwans participation in international affairs .</seg>
<seg id=505>" diversified diplomacy " is the centerpiece of the dpp 's overall diplomatic strategy . in the past year , we used " council of asian liberals & democrats " as a platform and successfully shared our experience with other countries in east asia and communicated with other political parties on issues of the regions economic challenges , democratic reform of political parties , eradication of mercenary politics , solutions to poverty resulting from globalization , political propaganda vs . communication and participation of young people in the government and other related topics .</seg>
<seg id=506>in march of next year , i myself will officially assume chairmanship of council of asian liberals & democrats ,  and i hope that in the capacity of a leader of an international organization , i can create more opportunities for taiwan to contribute more to the international community .</seg>
<seg id=507>in addition , the dpp has also actively involved in the affairs of liberal international after becoming its official member last year .</seg>
<seg id=508>apart from sending staff to serve as human rights commissioners in the secretariat of its headquarters in london , we will also cooperate with other member parties and hold seminars on political reforms in central and south america , europe and other regions .</seg>
<seg id=509>on september 28 , our party celebrated its 17th birthday .</seg>
<seg id=510>the 17 - year - old democratic progressive party has followed all the way its ideal of democracy and has been filled with strength for reforms and progress .</seg>
<seg id=511>we have won the trust of taiwanese people because we are always on the side of democratic reforms . it is also for this reason that our responsibility and mission in the future have become more serious and significant .</seg>
<seg id=512>when we took over the government three years ago , the previous ruling party had waded through six amendments to the constitution in the 1990s .</seg>
<seg id=513>from handling the total re-election of the parliament in 1991 , holding the direct presidential election in 1994 , freezing the provincial government functions in 1997 to abolishing the permanent status of the national assembly in 2000 , this series of difficult process of amending the constitution , is in fact the path the taiwanese people have followed in strengthening their sovereignty and justification of democratization .</seg>
<seg id=514>if we regard the direct presidential election by popular vote in 1996 as the most important symbol of taiwan as an independent and sovereign nation , then by 2006 this " complete " nation will have reached the age of 10 .</seg>
<seg id=515>after a decade of practice , we must ponder over this question : as an independent , sovereign and democratic nation , what should we pursue next ?</seg>
<seg id=516>i must say that in the next stage we should further pursue the deepening of democratization and a more efficient constitutional government system so as to be able to lead the taiwanese people in meeting the harsh challenges of the new century .</seg>
<seg id=517>as the largest continent in the world with an area constituting nearly 30% of the land on earth , a current population of about 60% of the world total and a total economic output making up a quarter of the world total , asia should and can make outstanding contribution to the world 's peace and development .</seg>
<seg id=518>asia boasts time - honored and brilliant cultures . the yellow river , the yangtze river valley , the indus and the ganges , the euphrates and the tigris basin are all famous cradles of human civilization .</seg>
<seg id=519>in the long course of history , the asian peoples have made remarkable contributions to the development of human civilization .</seg>
<seg id=520>since the modern period , asia has undergone great changes and suffered numerous hardships . in order to win liberation and seek development , people in all asian countries have made untiring efforts and achieved tremendous accomplishments .</seg>
<seg id=521>however , it is still a long way to go before asia can rise anew and rejuvenate .</seg>
<seg id=522>strengthening cooperation , promoting development and creating win - win situations are the only ways through which asia can rise anew and rejuvenate . it is also where the fundamental interest of asian people lies .</seg>
<seg id=523>in the new situation of the millennium , the development of asia is facing new opportunities .</seg>
<seg id=524>peace and development are still the main topics in today 's time . an overall peaceful international environment has provided favorable external conditions for the development of asia .</seg>
<seg id=525>economic globalization is deepening ; worldwide revolutions in science and technology are making progress by leaps and bounds ; and optimization and reorganization of international manufacturing resources and industrial outsourcing are accelerating . all these provide asian countries opportunities to utilize international funds , import advanced technologies , open up global markets and boost domestic economic growth .</seg>
<seg id=526>with its rich resources and vast market , asia is the most economically viable region in the world and promises tremendous potential for development .</seg>
<seg id=527>large population and underdevelopment are two major national conditions of china .</seg>
<seg id=528>since china has a population of 1.3 billion , no matter how tiny a problem is , it becomes a huge one once it is multiplied by 1.3 billion ; no matter how abundant financial and material resources are , they shrink to exceptionally minuscule average per capita once they are divided by 1.3 billion .</seg>
<seg id=529>this is what chinese leaders must keep firmly in their mind at any time .</seg>
<seg id=530>to solve the problem of 1.3 billion people , we can only rely on ourselves and nobody else .</seg>
<seg id=531>since the founding of the people 's republic of china , we have made great achievements in our development , yet at the same time we have taken some detours and missed a few opportunities .</seg>
<seg id=532>after we started the reform and opening up in 1978 , we finally found a right way for our own development .</seg>
<seg id=533>that is : chinese people build socialism with chinese characteristics independently and autonomously .</seg>
<seg id=534>its essence is to mobilize all positive factors , liberate and develop productive forces , and respect and ensure chinese people 's freedom to pursue happiness .</seg>
<seg id=535>china 's reform and opening up extended from rural areas to cities and from the economical area to political , cultural and social areas .</seg>
<seg id=536>each time it goes further , its objective , after all , is always to emancipate the competitive power of all labor , knowledge , technology , management and capital , and allow a complete utilization of all resources capable of creating social wealth .</seg>
<seg id=537>in recent years , the world has been undergoing profound changes . science and technology are making progress with each passing day ; the global productivity keeps going up ; and the markets in the world are in closer contact with one another , opening up historic opportunities for the development of all nations .</seg>
<seg id=538>however , it is noteworthy that power politics , regional conflicts , terrorism , epidemics , environmental deterioration and other issues are still threatening the stability and development in the world .</seg>
<seg id=539>the negative impact of economic globalization has increased the risk and cost of economic and social development in the developing countries , some of whom are even at risk of being marginalized .</seg>
<seg id=540>at present , we are still facing many uncertainties in spite of a gradual recovery of the global economy .</seg>
<seg id=541>the stalled doha round of multilateral trade negotiations , trade protectionism and other complicated issues have increased the hardship for the developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=542>fortunately , a great many developing countries have made remarkable achievements in making progress , implementing reforms and building a prosperous homeland .</seg>
<seg id=543>on the international arena , developing countries , relying on organizations such as non-alliance movement and g - 77 , have strengthened their solidarity and cooperation and made significant contributions in safeguarding their own legitimate rights and changing the unjust international political and economical order . they have become an important force in democratizing the international relations .</seg>
<seg id=544>in the meantime , great achievements have also been made in exchanges and cooperation among developing countries and their economic contacts have become more and more frequent .</seg>
<seg id=545>from the andes to the mekong , from the establishment of arab maghreb union to the africa union , south - south cooperation has been continuously enriched , improved and updated both in content and form and in mechanism and strategy .</seg>
<seg id=546>last year also saw the continuing all - round development of the friendly cooperation between china and canada .</seg>
<seg id=547>the trade between the two countries kept its growth with a total volume of trade reaching nearly 10 billion u.s. dollars .</seg>
<seg id=548>high - level contacts were frequent . a group of top canadian officials such as the foreign minister , defense minister , environmental minister and minister for international cooperation , visited china one by one , while china 's supreme court president , minister of commerce and other high - level officials also visited canada . more importantly , the reciprocal visits by the prime ministers of the two countries materialized .</seg>
<seg id=549>premier wen jiabao 's recent visit to canada is an important milestone in the history of the two nations . it instilled new vitalities for the further development of the relations between china and canada and laid a solid foundation for the friendly cooperation in various fields between the two countries to further develop both in scope and depth .</seg>
<seg id=550>china and canada will continue to strengthen their cooperation in politics , economics , culture and education , and science and technology among others and they will strive to double the total bilateral trade volume by 2010 .</seg>
<seg id=551>my fellow overseas countrymen and friends ,</seg>
<seg id=552>although you now live overseas , your hearts are always with your hometown . you are very much concerned with the development and progress of your motherland . at each and every crucial juncture , you always share both worries and happiness with the people in your motherland . your lives are linked with that of your motherland .</seg>
<seg id=553>last year , after some areas in china were hit by sars and floods , you showed your deep concern and good wishes to the people in your motherland via the internet , letters , telephone and donations , etc. overseas chinese from all walks of life also held a series of large - scale fundraising events and benefit performances . when shenzhou 5 successfully completed its manned space flight , your telephone calls , letters and cards of congratulation poured in ; everyone was excited and proud about the achievement made by china in space science and technology .</seg>
<seg id=554>during premier wen jiabao 's visit to canada , hundreds of overseas chinese and students braved the winter storm to come to the airport and parliament hill to welcome premier wen jiabao . there were many heart - touching scenes .</seg>
<seg id=555>now i 'd like to take this opportunity to express my heart - felt gratitude to all of you . i am sure you will continue to make new and greater contributions in this new year to the prosperity of china , the development of china - canada relations , and the complete reunification and rejuvenation of china .</seg>
<seg id=556>first , to strengthen mutual political trust and deepen strategic cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=557>as permanent member states of the un security council , both china and france have a significant influence on the international affairs .</seg>
<seg id=558>both of our countries are in favor of promoting multi-polarization of the world . we advocate the safeguarding of the un authority and are willing to help establish a new international political and economic order that meets the wishes of people in all countries .</seg>
<seg id=559>both of our countries have extensive consensus and common interests in meeting various challenges facing humanity , and in properly handling major international issues and others .</seg>
<seg id=560>we are willing to increase our dialogue and consultation with france on major issues such as fighting terrorism , preventing proliferation , cracking down on transnational crimes , promoting common development and strengthening the role of the un ; and to have close cooperation and to be committed to safeguarding the world peace and promoting common development .</seg>
<seg id=561>second , to strengthen economic and trade cooperation and achieve mutual benefits and complementarity .</seg>
<seg id=562>as the largest developing country in the world , china is going full steam ahead with its modernization and has a vast market .</seg>
<seg id=563>france , as a developed country and world leader in economy , science and technology , has cutting - edge technologies in many fields .</seg>
<seg id=564>the strong complementarity between our two economies promises a great potential for economic and trade cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=565>since the founding of new china , the chinese government has always placed a great emphasis on developing relations with africa and has formulated a series of guidelines and policies in this respect .</seg>
<seg id=566>we always adhere to the five principles of peaceful coexistence and respect african countries ' independence and autonomy in their choice of political system and way of development . we provide african countries assistance within our capabilities and carry out economic and technological cooperation . we support the solidarity and cooperation among african countries and their alliance for self empowerment . we urge the international community to pay attention to the peace and development in africa and support the equal participation of african countries in international affairs . we reinforce the consultation and cooperation between china and africa and jointly safeguard the rights and interests of developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=567>the friendship between china and africa dates back to ancient times and reaches deep into people 's hearts .</seg>
<seg id=568>since the founding of new china , we have always firmly supported the national liberation cause of africa and provided sincere assistance to the development of national economy in various african countries .</seg>
<seg id=569>chinese experts , doctors , teachers and workers dispatched to africa work shoulder by shoulder with the people there and get along well with them like real brothers and sisters .</seg>
<seg id=570>in international affairs , china and african countries understand and support each other and become partners who trust each other .</seg>
<seg id=571>the chinese people will never forget that at the 26th un assembly in 1971 , it was with the strong support from most developing countries , including various african countries , that china smoothly restored its legitimate seat in the united nations .</seg>
<seg id=572>in recent years , officials at various levels and in various fields in china and africa have built increasingly deeper mutual political trust . achievements have been made in economic cooperation and trade . the friendly exchanges in culture and education , health , science and technology , sports and other fields are thriving . the china - africa cooperation forum established at the beginning of this century has provided a new platform for the development of china - africa relations and the deepening of cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=573>as both china and africa have decided to establish a new type of long - term , stable partnership based on equality and mutual benefit , the friendly cooperation between china and africa has entered a new phase of an all - round development .</seg>
<seg id=574>seven years after nixon visited china and sino - u.s. shanghai communique was announced , the carter administration accepted china 's position on the taiwan issue and established diplomatic relations between china and the united states .</seg>
<seg id=575>this event and deng xiaoping 's successful visit to the united states opened a new page in the sino - american relations .</seg>
<seg id=576>in the early reagan administration , china and the united states had fierce clashes on the taiwan issue .</seg>
<seg id=577>after painstaking negotiations , the two governments announced the famous august 17 communique in 1982 and reached an agreement on the step - by - step resolution of the arms sales to taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=578>shanghai communique , the communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between china and the united states , and the august 17 communique jointly formed the political cornerstone for the sino - u.s. relations .</seg>
<seg id=579>during the ten years after the establishment of diplomatic relations , although the two countries fought over the taiwan issue and others from time to time , the overall sino - u.s. relations were stable with increasing contact and cooperation in all aspects .</seg>
<seg id=580>in the 1980s and early 1990s , east europe underwent dramatic transformation . with the dissolution of the soviet union and ending of the cold war , the international situation had experienced the most profound change since world war ii .</seg>
<seg id=581>the united states took the lead in imposing sanctions against china by announcing the sales of 150 f - 16 fighter jets to taiwan and linking the issue of human rights with the status of the most favorable nation . its permission of lee tung - hui to visit the united states brought the sino - u.s. relations to its lowest level .</seg>
<seg id=582>with the rapid economic development in china , china 's international status is continuously on the rise .</seg>
<seg id=583>more and more people in the united states have come to realize that it is in the interest of both china and the united states to improve and develop the sino - u.s. relations .</seg>
<seg id=584>six months ago , it was also in this hall that we successfully initiated the process of the six - nation talks and set firmly the direction of resolving the nuclear issue peacefully .</seg>
<seg id=585>in the past half year , all parties held constant talks and negotiations , making ample and indepth preparations for the new round of talks while getting to understand more each other 's position .</seg>
<seg id=586>now , all parties hope that the second round of talks will address the substantive issues and yield concrete results . all agree to resolve the mutual concerns through coordinated steps ; and all hope to keep the peace process started by the six - nation talks .</seg>
<seg id=587>these form the important basis for our talks today .</seg>
<seg id=588>the significance of the second round of talks lies in initiating the discussion of the substantive issues , which shows the process of peace talks takes another new step forward .</seg>
<seg id=589>this round of talks will cover how to set the concrete goal of resolving the nuclear issue , exploring the first - phase measures of resolving the nuclear issue and studying ways to maintain the process of talks .</seg>
<seg id=590>as the talks progress further , we will also meet more difficulties and face more challenges , but this is exactly the responsibility history has given us and the hope the international community has placed on us .</seg>
<seg id=591>here gather we six parties , representative of the strong political wish of seeking peace for the six nations and their peoples .</seg>
<seg id=592>the objective of our talks is to expand consensus not to highlight disagreements , to solve problems not to intensify conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=593>china believes each party , being aware of the peace mission on its shoulders , will take a constructive approach and in the spirit of cooperation and understanding will show mutual respect , demonstrate flexibility and narrow discrepancies .</seg>
<seg id=594>the second round of six - nation talks in beijing completed the scheduled agenda after more than three days of negotiatons .</seg>
<seg id=595>i am thankful to all the governments , all the delegation leaders and staff for their contributions .</seg>
<seg id=596>if we say the first round of talks set the grand goal of a nuclear - free peninsula , then the significance of this round of talks lies in conducting substantive dialogues and taking a big new step toward realizing the grand goal .</seg>
<seg id=597>during the talks , all parties conducted indepth and constructive discussions , explored ways and steps of solving the problems with wisdom and rationality , proposed valuable suggestions and made active declaration of policies .</seg>
<seg id=598>a series of beneficial results have been achieved at the talks . in particular , consensus has been reached on such issues as the next round of talks and the formation of a working group , which are of great importance for pushing forward the process of the peace talks .</seg>
<seg id=599>dear colleagues , peace and development are the topics of our great time .</seg>
<seg id=600>the peoples of the six nations , on whose behalf you are here , need peace , long for peace and love peace . peoples of all nations in the world need peace , long for peace and love peace .</seg>
<seg id=601>in these three days , the international community has been watching beijing and diaoyutai , placing great hopes in this round of talks .</seg>
<seg id=602>some people may think the talks did not yield enough results and the process did not move fast enough .</seg>
<seg id=603>my opinion is : this round of talks was started when the relevant parties lacked mutual trust and their differences in positions were widening .</seg>
<seg id=604>the chinese government has consistently adhered to the basic principle of " peaceful reunification and one country under two systems " on the issue of taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=605>for this goal , we have tried our best , demonstrated our utmost sincerity and done a great deal of work .</seg>
<seg id=606>however , our efforts are challenged by taiwan authorities and the forces of " taiwan 's independence . "</seg>
<seg id=607>we respect the desire of the taiwanese people for democracy , but we oppose the attempts by taiwan authorities and " separatist " forces to pursue taiwan 's independence and cut off taiwan from its motherland in the name of democracy .</seg>
<seg id=608>the reason why we clearly demonstrate our determination and will to preserve the unity of our motherland is that we want to safeguard the peace and stability across the taiwan strait .</seg>
<seg id=609>as we have expressed , as long as there is a slim chance of hope , we will work to our utmost to bring about the peaceful reunification of our motherland .</seg>
<seg id=610>we appreciate president bush 's reiteration of one - china position , which sent a clear signal to the " taiwan 's independence " forces .</seg>
<seg id=611>taiwan authorities claim : " in order to prevent china from invading taiwan by force and unilaterally changing the status quo across the taiwan strait , we must push for the march 20 peace referendum . "</seg>
<seg id=612>this is a vilification of the mainland 's peace efforts as well as a provocation of the cross - strait relations .</seg>
<seg id=613>at present , the real threat to taiwan 's security does not come from the mainland but from the unbridled " taiwan 's independence " separatist activities staged by taiwan authorities .</seg>
<seg id=614>it is none other than the separatist forces that are the direct cause of undermining the status quo in the cross - strait relations and jeopardizing the peace in the taiwan strait .</seg>
<seg id=615>taiwan authorities distort the chinese mainland 's opposition to " taiwan 's independence " and its preservation of the stability across the taiwan strait as attempts to attack and crush the democracy and freedom in taiwan and use them as an excuse to launch the referendum .</seg>
<seg id=616>this is a groudless accusation turning the truth upside down and aiming to fraudulently gain sympathy and support for their continuous promotion of separatism .</seg>
<seg id=617>taiwan authorities claim the upcoming referendum as so called " defensive referendum " and " peace referendum . " yet however packaged , this act of provocation will only increase the cross - strait hostility and hatred , intensifying the cross - strait tension and pushing the cross - strait relations step by step to the brink of danger .</seg>
<seg id=618>this completely runs counter to taiwan compatriots ' mainstream aspiration for peace , stability and development . instead of deepening " democratization " in taiwan , it misleads and manipulates the taiwan people . it is also a serious threat to peace and stability in the asia pacific region and will surely meet with universal opposition by people across the strait and by the international community .</seg>
<seg id=619>a general review of the historic process of the development of the chinese nation shows that the unification has always been the mainstream . it is where the dominant trend leads and where the heart belongs .</seg>
<seg id=620>as the motherland grows increasingly stronger and the cross - strait cooperation continues to deepen , the one - china status generally recognized by the international community will stand more solidified and any attempt at splittism is doomed to failure .</seg>
<seg id=621>there are a little over two weeks left before the lunar new year , which is one of the most observed traditional holidays for chinese .</seg>
<seg id=622>on this jolly occasion , we are accustomed to getting together with close relatives and good friends and exchanging gifts to show our hearts .</seg>
<seg id=623>hongkong post , in its motto of " linking people , delivering business , " is promoting this " hong kong / mainland gift fulfilment service " in collaboration with china post to deliver hong kong people 's regards and best wishes to their relatives and customers living in the mainland or in hong kong during the spring festival .</seg>
<seg id=624>hongkong post has always been committed to collaboration with its counterparts to provide international fulfilment service .</seg>
<seg id=625>as early as december 2002 , it launched foreign wine fulfilment service jointly with its australian counterpart to provide hong kong residents quality products .</seg>
<seg id=626>this time we collaborate with china post and further expand our close cooperation long established in the fields of postal affairs , postal remittance , express delivery into cross - border fulfilment service . it is to meet the increasing market demand of hong kong residents for sending gifts to their relatives or customers in the mainland that we launch this " hong kong / mainland gift fulfilment service . "</seg>
<seg id=627>the first batch of gifts includes new year 's gift boxes , which come in different varieties and are exquisitely packaged . inside the boxes are holiday candies , tea leaves and dried seafood featuring a great selection to choose from , depending on budget .</seg>
<seg id=628>they are all ideal gifts either for relatives or friends in the mainland or for business partners .</seg>
<seg id=629>for three decades , the contribution made by the consumer council to protecting the rights and interests of consumers is evident to all .</seg>
<seg id=630>there has been no better way to assess the performance of the consumer council than finding out if the rights and interests of consumers have been substantially improved .</seg>
<seg id=631>i strongly agree with what chairman chen just said . after thirty years , not only consumers have become clearly aware of their own rights and interests , but also their rights and interests are valued by all sectors of society . this is the result of hard work by both the consumer council and the government .</seg>
<seg id=632>the consumer council tests products periodically , conducts market surveys on various products and services , and studies industrial operations . through its monthly " choice , " it releases fair and objective market information to the public .</seg>
<seg id=633>the monthly " choice " has won the trust of citizens . now that the monthly " choice " is developing its online version , it will play its role more efficiently in assisting consumers to access market information more conveniently and quickly .</seg>
<seg id=634>the consumer council has 11 regional consumer consultation centers and 16 hotlines to provide consumers information concerning products and services and take consumers ' complaints .</seg>
<seg id=635>since the establishment of the consumer council , the number of inquiries it receives has continued to grow , from about a few thousands at the beginning of its establishment in the 1970s up to 146,000 inquiries last year . the increase rate of over 20 times shows more and more consumers consult the consumer council 's reports and opinions before choosing products and services .</seg>
<seg id=636>in addition , the consumer council processed more than 26,000 complaints this year .</seg>
<seg id=637>the consumer council also red flags a few individual stores that are unethically run , which not only helps consumers guard against fraud but also serves as deterrent to store managers .</seg>
<seg id=638>legislator yang , on july 1 , i told you i watched tv closely and i later did quite a lot of self examination . i noticed citizens had many complaints and grudges , and were dissatisfied with the performance of the government .</seg>
<seg id=639>in this respect , the government and i both tried very hard to make improvement during the past six or seven months . when we saw that citizens demanded for improvement of economy and life , we also worked very hard toward that . when we knew that citizens had many complaints about article 23 of the " basic law , " we took article 23 out . the government indeed responded immediately .</seg>
<seg id=640>as for the social appeal for democracy , i also understand it clearly .</seg>
<seg id=641>however , legislator yang , i want to tell you that what i am doing today is exactly to ensure that everything can be done smoothly once the review of the constitutional development starts . therefore , some basic problems must be solved first . these are totally two different things .</seg>
<seg id=642>what are the basic problems ?</seg>
<seg id=643>some are problems of principle , while others are problems concerning law , involving the interpretation of some articles about the review of constitutional development in the " basic law . " we must do some work on this first .</seg>
<seg id=644>we are now working on this part . a three - person task force has already started to do this work .</seg>
<seg id=645>it will consult the central government and will also take soundings in hong kong . i think this is a very good step . it is a decision we made because we value the public opinion in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=646>in today 's highly competitive commercial environment , the brand name plays a crucial role in the success of a product .</seg>
<seg id=647>to create a brand name takes more than a single day . it requires a creative design , premium quality , thoughtful packaging , effective marketing and sustained investment .</seg>
<seg id=648>hong kong has the making of a brand name .</seg>
<seg id=649>we have relevant knowledge , skills and experience , and a galaxy of talent from designing , manufacturing , marketing to management . in addition we have a vast market .</seg>
<seg id=650>the cepa which just went into effect will add to our advantages . in addition to its preferential treatment of zero tariffs for accessing the mainland market , the best of cepa lies in motivating businesspeople to find ways to increase the added value of their products so that they become popular brand names in hong kong , the mainland and even in the world .</seg>
<seg id=651>the voting of " hong kong top ten brand names " by the chinese manufacturers ' association of hong kong happens to be based on the same idea as the cepa 's promotion of developing value - added hong kong products .</seg>
<seg id=652>over five years , this voting has created 51 " hong kong top ten brand names . "</seg>
<seg id=653>however , in the vast market of the mainland , 51 brand names amount to almost nothing . we need " hong kong top brand names " by the hundred , the thousand , and even more .</seg>
<seg id=654>for years , hong kong 's mtrc has been participating in the subway projects in the major cities of mainland china , bringing its rich experience in hong kong to the mainland market by means of service .</seg>
<seg id=655>i am very pleased that hong kong 's investment , professional services and the quality of management personnel have been recognized in the mainland market .</seg>
<seg id=656>such exchanges between shenzhen and hong kong not only help the development of the motherland but also provide hong kong businesspeople more opportunities for development . they do more than boost economy as they also provide more job opportunities for hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=657>it is with the help of supportive policies of the central government , the government of shenzhen special economic zone and many others that we have reached an agreement in principle on this project . i hereby extend my great thanks .</seg>
<seg id=658>for the first time , the mtrc has gone beyond hong kong to participate in the development of the mainland subways through investments and bring even more hong kong brand names to the mainland . this is indeed something that people in hong kong and mainland should feel happy about .</seg>
<seg id=659>i hereby wish for an early official approval from the central government for line 4 of shenzhen metro system and for a smooth construction of the project so that a stronger foundation will be laid for more exchange and cooperation between shenzhen and hong kong in the future .</seg>
<seg id=660>today is january 5 of the lunar new year . i am very happy to be invited by the chinese gold & silver exchange society to attend your group exchange of new year greetings and to host the opening ceremony of the gold market for the new year .</seg>
<seg id=661>first of all , let me extend my greeting to each of you and wish you all be energetic , lucky , prosperous , and successful in the year of the monkey .</seg>
<seg id=662>in the past year the price of gold rose dramatically . recently it even exceeded the level of 400 u.s. dollar per ounce . the sustained strong rise reflects investors ' renewed confidence in gold .</seg>
<seg id=663>i believe my colleagues must have also had a good business last year .</seg>
<seg id=664>in fact , the thriving market owes as much to the external factors as to the successful management of the gold & silver exchange society for more than 90 years of hard work .</seg>
<seg id=665>the hard work has not only laid a solid foundation for the gold market in hong kong but also contributed even more to the consolidation of hong kong 's position as an international financial center .</seg>
<seg id=666>as the old saying goes that " make your plan for the year in spring , " i hope all my colleagues at the gold & silver exchange society will continue to work hard in the coming year , seize the " golden " time of the gold and silver industry , take hold of the demand for gold trade brought about by the gold market reform in the mainland , china 's accession to the wto and cepa , and further promote the market development .</seg>
<seg id=667>i believe that with my colleagues ' active promotion , the gold market in hong kong will surely have brilliant performance in the coming year .</seg>
<seg id=668>finally , let me wish for a very prosperous year of the monkey for the gold market , all industries and businesses .</seg>
<seg id=669>thank you very much .</seg>
<seg id=670>however , the challenges in the past were not limited to government - funded public housing . private housing was also greatly challenged .</seg>
<seg id=671>the financial crisis in 1997 led to the burst of assets bubble . as a result , real estate prices plunged by 70%, hitting property owners really hard . this was also the main reason that deflation was aggravated several times over the past five years .</seg>
<seg id=672>now that economy is turning around , we are determined to maintain a stable environment and ensure the real estate market will continue its steady growth .</seg>
<seg id=673>a healthy real estate market is indeed of crucial importance to the continuous recovery of hong kong 's economy .</seg>
<seg id=674>we are also devoted to protecting and improving our living environment .</seg>
<seg id=675>our future efforts should be based on the principle of sustainable development . we will improve our living environment through more proper urban design and better protection of natural and cultural heritage in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=676>we will double our attention to the issue of overall environment .</seg>
<seg id=677>the lesson we learned from the sars outbreak in hong kong last year reminds us that we must make every effort to create a more spacious , cleaner and healthier living environment .</seg>
<seg id=678>we will provide better landscaping and more greenery ; and add parks and leisure and recreational facilities for the benefit of the community .</seg>
<seg id=679>many council members have expressed their opinions on the sections concerning legislature and law , political system , civil servants and government - funded public service employees , and security in the chief executive 's " policy address , " and i hereby extend my appreciation to them .</seg>
<seg id=680>only councilwoman margaret ng and councilman tsang yok - sing have spoken about the subjects of the judicial and legal services . they are chair and vice chair of judicial and legal affairs committee of the legislative council .</seg>
<seg id=681>the chief executive put forward many measures to promote people - based governance such as increasing contact of key officials with the public , conducting more studies on public policy , strengthening the cooperation between the government and the legislative council and carrying out serious reviews of the constitutional development .</seg>
<seg id=682>department of justice will fully participate in the aforementioned work and ensure all government measures comply with laws and procedures and in particular with the " basic law , " including the basic civil rights and freedom it protects . in the meantime , the department will keep vigilance as councilwoman ng said to safeguard the independence of the rule of law and the judiciary in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=683>as a chief officer , i will certainly try my best to understand the opinions of the general public and the legal community on the issues that affect judicial affairs and legal profession .</seg>
<seg id=684>for example , cepa is a product of the close cooperation among the government and the business community , including hong kong bar association , the law society of hong kong and the association of china appointed attesting officers ltd .</seg>
<seg id=685>we have successfully included " legal services " in the cepa and made it one of the service industries opened by the mainland . this has provided a new platform for stepping up the cooperation in legal services between the two sides and will bring macro and long - term benefits to the legal services on both sides .</seg>
<seg id=686>the work of the task force is bidirectional . we will report to the central government about what we did taking soundings in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=687>from mid - january of this year up till now , we have interviewed about a dozen of groups and individuals .</seg>
<seg id=688>all of them fully accept that the constitutional development in hong kong needs to comply with " one country , two systems , " and that hong kong sar is under the direct jurisdiction of the central government .</seg>
<seg id=689>most of them believe that the constitutional system of hong kong needs improvement ; yet at the same time they also accept that any development must be within the framework of the " basic law . "</seg>
<seg id=690>the groups and individuals also have their own opinions on a few procedural and legal issues .</seg>
<seg id=691>the task force will fully convey these wishes , views and statements of opinion of theirs to the central government .</seg>
<seg id=692>in the coming month or so , the task force will continue to interview other groups and individuals and we will forward the opinions we receive successively to the central government .</seg>
<seg id=693>today 's meeting is only the first one the task force has with the relevant agency of the central government ; and we will still need to continue our follow - up and exchange of views with the central government .</seg>
<seg id=694>i believe everybody understands that the development of the constitutional system involves the relations between the central government and the sar ; that the central government also has the constitutional right and responsibility to review the constitutional development in the sar and that we need to fully consult with the central government .</seg>
<seg id=695>west kowloon cultural district is a large - scale cultural and arts project hong kong has never undertaken before . it is not only a project that provides our residents with a space for cultural and art pursuits , recreation and entertainment , but also a project to raise the qualities of the urban life and its residents .</seg>
<seg id=696>the construction of west kowloon cultural district entails the participation of the entire hong kong community .</seg>
<seg id=697>the government must continue working with people from all walks of life for exploration in more depth and collect wisdom from a wide range of sources .</seg>
<seg id=698>we understand that we cannot pursue esthetic beauty of the architecture alone . we must also make the project capable of generating economical benefits , sustaining development and raising the quality of life of urban residents .</seg>
<seg id=699>therefore , the government attaches great importance to support services for west kowloon cultural district . they must work in conjunction with relevant measures , including the management policies on the facilities , promotion tactics for the cultural programs , contents of performances and exhibitions , advertising tactics , etc.</seg>
<seg id=700>the formulation of these relevant tactics must be carefully based on the opinions of the " users . "</seg>
<seg id=701>the young generation , including every young friend present here , will be one of the major types of users of west kowloon cultural district in the future .</seg>
<seg id=702>it is our hope that people , young and old , with refined or popular taste , can all enjoy this district . it will be such a place of attraction that both hong kong residents and tourists from other places , mature adults or lively youth , will love to stay forever .</seg>
<seg id=703>i know you held a discussion on several different aspects of west kowloon cultural district this morning . some students even spent a lot of time and energy in the past month or so preparing the special reports . i am sure you are already very familiar with the details of the project .</seg>
<seg id=704>i just could not wait to hear the result of your discussion and hope i can exchange opinions with you .</seg>
<seg id=705>since the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , the global attention has focused on the security at seaports , airports and borders .</seg>
<seg id=706>as the port of origin in the world that ships the largest number of containers to the united states , hong kong undoubtedly responded promptly to the " container security initiative " put forward by the united states .</seg>
<seg id=707>in addition , we believe that cutting off the life line of terrorist groups can also be an effective measure to stop terrorist activities .</seg>
<seg id=708>every day , large sums of funds flowing in and out of the global financial system have always puzzled the law enforcement agencies that target criminal profit - making and money laundering .</seg>
<seg id=709>as a key financial center in asia , we believe cutting off funds of terrorists may be the most effective way to destroy their network from its very foundation .</seg>
<seg id=710>at present , hong kong 's legislative body is discussing various proposals for improvement so as to tighten the existing laws and regulations that aim at cracking down on terrorist funding . it is also amending laws and regulations in active compliance with the international standards and situation such as the new proposal by the financial action task force on money laundering .</seg>
<seg id=711>besides , we are also trying to draw up a better information disclosure law to make it easier for agencies and individuals to report suspicious transactions .</seg>
<seg id=712>" balance " is also the key in this job : valid investigation right , freedom and personal privacy protected by the constitution , and efficiency of economic and financial systems are all factors that must be considered .</seg>
<seg id=713>our regulatory measures are based on the rule of law , transparency , fairness and efficiency .</seg>
<seg id=714>in fact , the service sector in hong kong has advantages in many aspects .</seg>
<seg id=715>professionals and commercial service personnel in hong kong have a deep understanding of the business operations both in mainland china and the rest of the world .</seg>
<seg id=716>professional services in hong kong like accounting , finance , law , arbitration , etc. are the best partners for the mainland businesses in their globalization and getting in line with the world market .</seg>
<seg id=717>our transport , construction , designing and market promotion , management consulting , information science and technology , conventions and exhibitions and other services , on the other hand , can help enhance the overall productivity and competitiveness of the mainland enterprises and assist them in developing strategies for market promotion of products and improving brand images .</seg>
<seg id=718>services like tourism , healthcare and insurance can all the more assist in the development of the related markets and industries in the mainland and improve their quality of service .</seg>
<seg id=719>the close cooperation between service industries in hong kong and the mainland will greatly enhance the existing advantages each has now and help both in taking the opportunities and challenges brought about by the economic globalization .</seg>
<seg id=720>in order to promote the development of professional service industries in the mainland market , secretary for finance and i , together with officials from the policy bureaux and administration division and several representatives from different professional industries , just had substantive and valuable discussions in beijing last week on mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other topics of interest to the business community with the relevant departments and counterpart industries in the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=721>i am very pleased that we have taken the first important step toward the business development of the mainland market by signing the agreements on mutual recognition of qualifications and cooperation in the three professional industries of construction , structural engineering and insurance .</seg>
<seg id=722>through this meeting , the professional industries in hong kong have also established closer relations with the regulatory agencies in the mainland and laid a good foundation for the friendly cooperation in the next stage .</seg>
<seg id=723>i believe the great majority of hong kong citizens love the motherland and love hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=724>in fact , either before or after its return to china , hong kong has always had very close and interdependent economic , social , political and cultural ties with the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=725>in the economic field , hong kongs industry has had a chance to move north and gained new space for development since our country instituted the four modernization programs , implemented reforms and the opening up more than two decades ago . this , as we can see , has brought hong kong community into closer touch with the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=726>recently , we have another chance to make an arrangement with the central government for closer economic and trade relations so that various service sectors in hong kong can have new opportunities to participate more actively and more extensively in the economic development in the mainland and to make a new round of contributions to our country and hong kong . this will also bring hong kong and the mainland closer together .</seg>
<seg id=727>in social development , we see the country has been making phenomenal progress in recent years .</seg>
<seg id=728>hong kong citizens were very excited when they saw beijings successful bid for hosting the 2008 olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=729>a few months earlier , they were equally excited when yang weili paid a visit to hong kong . why is so ?</seg>
<seg id=730>because we think everybody , every hong kong citizen should feel proud for such achievement made by our country .</seg>
<seg id=731>i know that legislative council started to discuss with the government about the site of the permanent office of legislative council as early as ten years ago .</seg>
<seg id=732>likewise , the government has also been pondering over the long - term plan of relocating the government headquarters for more than a decade .</seg>
<seg id=733>therefore , i understand the government 's decision to postpone the tamar project which includes the new legislative council complex will certainly disappoint some of the legislators .</seg>
<seg id=734>i know that the legislators will have to suffer some inconvenience by continuing to work in a less than satisfactory place for this period of time .</seg>
<seg id=735>however , just as i said to my colleagues in the government who are also affected by this decision , i hope everybody can give priority to public interests , understand the factors involved and exercise more patience during this period .</seg>
<seg id=736>earlier i explained many times to the legislative council commission that after considering the current fiscal situation and the financial status in the wake of the sars outbreak last year , the government does not consider it an appropriate time now to proceed with the tamar project or any large - scale office building project .</seg>
<seg id=737>postponing the project of the new legislative council complex at tamar will help reduce the financial pressure on the government in the coming years . it is in the public interests and is also accepted by the public .</seg>
<seg id=738>the government will resume the project of developing the new legislative council complex at tamar as soon as public finances improve . our current plan will do so .</seg>
<seg id=739>our country cares very much about hong kong . so do the chairman and the premier . i know they and the central government will make every effort to do a good job in this area .</seg>
<seg id=740>so , good news will come in succession from tourism , finance , infrastructure coordination , freedom traffic rights , zero - tariff on products and service industry .</seg>
<seg id=741>i also sincerely hope that with its economic recovery , hong kong can capitalize more on its advantages to make greater contribution to the development of our country .</seg>
<seg id=742>when i met premier wen jiabao , i , on behalf of hong kong , also congratulated him on the admirable achievement our country made under his leadership during the past difficult year . although many challenges lie ahead , he is full of confidence as you have all heard from his work report . we are all very much encouraged by that .</seg>
<seg id=743>premier wen also told me that reviewing mr. deng xiaoping 's important remarks on " one country , two systems " 20 years ago is of great significance for us to have a complete and accurate understanding of the principle of " one country , two systems , " which will be very helpful for the constitutional development in the future .</seg>
<seg id=744>he also told me that people of hong kong should really seize this opportunity to focus on economic development and improvement on living standards . he is full of confidence in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=745>later i will meet with mr. zhang dejiang , secretary of guangdong provincial party committee , and governor huang huahua , to discuss with them how to push our cooperation to a higher level and create a bigger win - win situation based on our current achievements .</seg>
<seg id=746>the last point is the notion of " hong kong governed by the people of hong kong " that everybody has become familiar with recently . this system requires that hong kong be governed by the people of hong kong , the majority of whom are patriots .</seg>
<seg id=747>there are also clear - cut standards for being patriots . they should be those people of hong kong who respect their own nation , sincerely support the restoration of our country 's sovereignty over hong kong and refrain from doing anything detrimental to our country and hong kong . it is these patriots that make the majority of the government who should govern hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=748>i must reiterate that the people of hong kong as a whole are patriotic .</seg>
<seg id=749>what is referred to here is not the ordinary hong kong citizens but those individuals who participate in the management of public affairs in hong kong and hold key positions in the administrative body , the legislative council and the judicial branch .</seg>
<seg id=750>when they are sworn into office , they must show their support for the " basic law " of hong kong sar of the people 's republic of china in accordance with the " basic law " and pledge their allegiance to the hong kong sar of the people 's republic of china .</seg>
<seg id=751>the above five or six principles and their serious considerations i have talked about are actually the set of long - term guidelines and policies that had been set forth as early as in the 1980s when people started to talk about the distant future of hong kong , worked on " the joint declaration " and finalized the " basic law . " it has so far remained unchanged and will never be changed . since it is a series of long - term guidelines and policies governing our countrys restoration of sovereignty over hong kong and it is our state policy , it will never be changed .</seg>
<seg id=752>several hundred years after its establishment , especially since the industrial revolution , the system of intellectual property has brought forth a succession of major inventions of epoch - breaking significance .</seg>
<seg id=753>in the recent two decades , the system of intellectual property has become the basic legal system and important policy and measure for various countries in promoting technological innovation and has played a key role in boosting their economy and enhancing their international competitiveness .</seg>
<seg id=754>at present , with the rapid development of science and technology and economic globalization , the quantity and quality of intellectual property ownership as well as the creation , possession and application of knowledge and intellectual resources have become the important foundation for all countries in participating in the international competitions .</seg>
<seg id=755>therefore , stepping up the international exchange and cooperation in intellectual property protection is of great importance to the establishment of a just and reasonable new international economic order , and to the promotion of the global economic prosperity and development .</seg>
<seg id=756>the chinese government lays great emphasis on intellectual property protection .</seg>
<seg id=757>our country started to establish the system of intellectual property in the early stage of our reform and opening up . after more than two decades of hard work , we have developed a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property and established a system of intellectual property protection which combines both judicial and executive branches . we have done a great deal of work in the area of intellectual property protection and made an important contribution to the progress of science and technology and economic and social development .</seg>
<seg id=758>as the world entered the information age in the 21st century , science and technology will promote the development of mans productivity with unprecedented force .</seg>
<seg id=759>for our country to expand opening up to the outside world in the new century , it is necessary to further improve our system of intellectual property and strengthen international exchange and cooperation in intellectual property protection . it is also necessary for the construction of a modern socialist country and the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .</seg>
<seg id=760>we are willing to work together with various countries in the world to establish a system of intellectual property , which is just , reasonable and conducive to the promotion of science and technology and economic development in all countries , and to create a good environment in which all the people respect knowledge , advocate science and protect intellectual property .</seg>
<seg id=761>the most important task for shanghai cooperation organization now is to speed up the institutionalization of the organization .</seg>
<seg id=762>thanks to efforts by all parties , great progress has been made in the preparation for the set - up of the secretariat and a regional anti-terrorism agency .</seg>
<seg id=763>we will redouble our efforts to ensure that the secretariat start its official operation within this year and the regional anti-terrorism agency be set up as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=764>to show that it takes sco seriously , the chinese government , as a hosting nation for organizing the secretariat , has decided to provide the secretariat free offices .</seg>
<seg id=765>in the future , we will also continue to provide strong support for the smooth operation of the secretariat .</seg>
<seg id=766>it has always been the sco 's focus of work to deepen and promote security cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=767>we will be always on guard against the " three forces " that have done serious harm to the interests of all member countries in the region and will never allow them to have their way .</seg>
<seg id=768>we should make unrelenting efforts on a long - term basis to eradicate these evil forces so as to effectively safeguard the security and stability in the region .</seg>
<seg id=769>in order to cut off the financial sources for the activities of the " three forces " and combat these " three forces " more completely and effectively , we should put the issue of fighting drug trafficking on the agenda of the security cooperation as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=770>economic cooperation is the important foundation and prioritized direction for the sco .</seg>
<seg id=771>education is the cornerstone of the modern civilization .</seg>
<seg id=772>to enhance the overall quality of the people in our country and increase total national capabilities , education must be vigorously promoted .</seg>
<seg id=773>rural education has a wide range of impact and affects the overall rural economy and social development .</seg>
<seg id=774>since the reform and opening up , tremendous and profound changes have taken place in both cities and rural areas in our country . this owes a great deal to the education , especially the rural education .</seg>
<seg id=775>the implementation in rural areas of the family contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output has greatly liberated the productive forces .</seg>
<seg id=776>one of the underlying reasons why advanced and practical farming technologies can be extensively applied , why rural enterprises can suddenly emerge as a new force , and why the surplus labor in rural areas can have a massive migration to the coastal areas and towns and cities is that they are all backed by a rural labor force of hundreds of millions of people who have received obligatory education . credit should be given to universal obligatory education in rural areas .</seg>
<seg id=777>at present , the agriculture and rural economy in our country are in a crucial stage of development . the development of high quality , high efficient , ecologically - friendly and safe agriculture , the expansion of industrialized agriculture and the relocation of rural surplus labor force all make it an urgent need to fully raise the overall qualification of rural labor force .</seg>
<seg id=778>the emergence in the world of a revolution in new science and technology and the progress made in building an overall well - to - do society have raised higher demands for the scientific , cultural , ideological and moral qualifications of the vast majority of rural population .</seg>
<seg id=779>without the implementation of universal compulsory 9th grade education in rural areas and comprehensive enhancement of qualification of peasants , it would be very hard to realize an overall well - to - do society .</seg>
<seg id=780>we must fully recognize that rural education constitutes a fundamental , precursory and integral part of our efforts to building an overall well - to - do society .</seg>
<seg id=781>among the advisors and distinguished guests who attend this conference are famous top leaders of multinational corporations , world renowned economists and accomplished experts and scholars .</seg>
<seg id=782>i am deeply touched by the sincere cooperation and the active and pragmatic approach demonstrated by all the advisors .</seg>
<seg id=783>bringing our cooperation and collective wisdom into full play not only helps in planning and promoting the development of guangdong but also helps our concerted efforts in promoting cooperation and development in all fields .</seg>
<seg id=784>i had been looking forward to the 2003 international consultation conference on economic development of guangdong so that i can listen to and learn about your valuable advice on the economic and social development of guangdong .</seg>
<seg id=785>we are happily gathering here today to pursue one common goal : to strengthen cooperation and exchange , seek more space for development , infuse new vitalities into the economic and social development of guangdong and create opportunities for the development of your businesses .</seg>
<seg id=786>china 's accession to the wto marks a brand new phase of the opening up to the outside world as we are participating in the international competition in broader areas , more extensive fields and at higher levels .</seg>
<seg id=787>as a province with the highest degree of overseas - oriented economy in the mainland , guangdong has been the first to experience the unprecedented opportunities for development and to meet the accompanying harsh challenges .</seg>
<seg id=788>against such a backdrop , we must seize new opportunities and meet new challenges , enhance our international competitiveness in all aspects and actively proceed with the modernization programs . we must strive to open up new prospects for economic cooperation so as to achieve common development through long - term , mutually complementary and beneficial cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=789>the people of guangdong are focused on building an overall well - to - do society and accelerating their efforts for modernization , which will create more opportunities and room for development for all our friends .</seg>
<seg id=790>the economy of guangdong , thriving with vitality and broad prospects , is rising vigorously to new heights .</seg>
<seg id=791>recently , iraq 's interim governing council and the u.s. occupying authorities signed an agreement in baghdad , announcing a timetable for a step - by - step transfer of power to hand over the government back to iraq by june next year .</seg>
<seg id=792>this agreement was reluctantly approved by the international community : although the meeting of the eu foreign ministers welcomed the move , france considered " the process too slow ; " while annan , the un secretary general , felt encouraged about this plan of power transfer , he said " its still premature " for the united nations to play its role in iraq ; russia , on the other hand , flatly contested the legitimacy of the agreement .</seg>
<seg id=793>the iraqis gave a cold response ; public opinions in the united states even consider it " a big gamble . "</seg>
<seg id=794>in short , most people are still somewhat skeptical and choose to wait and see .</seg>
<seg id=795>it is not without reason that the international community has so many doubts .</seg>
<seg id=796>as people see it , the united states is not returning power to iraq out of its own accord . it is therefore impossible to have a complete transfer of power and there are bound to be many unexpected developments .</seg>
<seg id=797>first , the interim transitional government set to be established in may next year is not to be directly elected by the iraqi people but will be elected by the " transitional national assembly " that is selected by 18 governorate selection caucuses .</seg>
<seg id=798>this will be hard to be free from suspicion of the u.s. control and its legitimacy may be questioned .</seg>
<seg id=799>second , the united states has already announced that it will not withdraw its military forces after handing over the power . it will merely change the original " military occupation " to " military presence . "</seg>
<seg id=800>the u.s. government announced on november 18 that it had decided to impose quotas on three types of textile imports from china , namely : knit fabric , brassieres and dressing gowns .</seg>
<seg id=801>at a time when china is continuing its efforts to expand the economic and trade cooperation between china and the united states , it is deeply regrettable that the u.s. government should take this measure of trade protectionism .</seg>
<seg id=802>at this phase of economic globalization , the new quotas the united states imposes on chinas textile imports are out of accord with the times .</seg>
<seg id=803>first , this abuse of " quotas " hinders the implementation of the wto 's principle of free trade .</seg>
<seg id=804>isnt it too arbitrary and unfair to give pompous talks on free trade while backstabbing others with quotas at every opportunity in order to rebuild trade barriers ?</seg>
<seg id=805>second , " quotas " set a cap on the trend of development toward wholesome economic and trade relations between china and the united states .</seg>
<seg id=806>since china and the united states reached an agreement in 1999 on china 's accession to the wto , the u.s. exports to china have enjoyed an average annual increase of 15%.</seg>
<seg id=807>from january to september this year , u.s. exports to china increased by 26.2% over the same period of the preceding year .</seg>
<seg id=808>in the past two years , u.s. exports of raw materials for textiles and finished products to china have risen sharply .</seg>
<seg id=809>in fact , china today has become a country to which the u.s. exports have enjoyed the fastest growth among all the countries in the world .</seg>
<seg id=810>there are many reasons why bush 's visit to the u . k . did not accomplish its goal . the most important one is that after the cold war was over , the united states has become the only superpower in the world , which has led to its total disregard of others and excessive unilateralism .</seg>
<seg id=811>the united states launched the war on iraq without the un authorization . with no respect for the opinions of its chief allies on major international issues such as the rebuilding of iraq , the united states persists in its own ways and has thus roused everybodys fury .</seg>
<seg id=812>a poll survey recently released by the eu commission shows that 68% of the eu citizens think the united states did not have adequate justification to launch the war on iraq and 53% believe the united states now poses a threat to the world peace .</seg>
<seg id=813>second , although the united states lays emphasis on fighting terrorism and wants its allies to contribute human and financial resources , it turns a deaf ear to their concerns .</seg>
<seg id=814>with a firm hold on iraq 's reconstruction projects , the united states gave major contracts in the first bid to the corporations in its own country , unwilling to share even a tiny piece of the pie with others . as for the dispute on the steel trade , the wto ruled that the united states ' high tariffs have violated the regulations . people in the u . k . business circles had hoped bush might make concessions during this visit , yet the united states eventually failed to clearly state its position .</seg>
<seg id=815>third , the united states put its own values as supreme guidelines above those of all other nations . its insistence that middle east countries carry out democratic reforms has been censured . some allies request that the united states respect the culture and special features of islamic countries . they believe that one of the reasons that the united states is deeply bogged down in iraq is exactly the dire consequence of its " disrespect . "</seg>
<seg id=816>however , bush will not change his ways just because of the widespread criticism and opposition . during this visit , he again defended his iraq policy and emphasized that the u.s. - british coalition forces will continue to use force to deal with the violence in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=817>since bush 's visit to the u . k . failed to accomplish its goal , the situation in iraq will not necessarily develop the way the white house hopes for .</seg>
<seg id=818>after more than six months of debate , an advance contingent of japan 's self-defense forces finally headed for iraq before the end of 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=819>this is the first time since the end of world war ii that japan has sent troops to overseas battlefields .</seg>
<seg id=820>it reflects the will of japan in becoming a political and military power and also signals a shift in its defense strategy .</seg>
<seg id=821>the reason why this trip of the sdf has drawn so much attention is that it is not an isolated case .</seg>
<seg id=822>taking advantage of the war in afghanistan , japan made the breakthrough of letting the sdf go outside japan . by using the problem in the korean peninsula as an excuse , japan passed the " crisis legislation , " making preparations for the sdf 's use of force or even preemptive strikes . recently , the koizumi cabinet again passed " the basic plan for iraqi reconstruction assistance , " paving the way for the military dispatch to iraq .</seg>
<seg id=823>step by step , this finally led to the breakthrough of the restriction of japan 's pacifist constitution and military deployment to overseas battlefields .</seg>
<seg id=824>in addition , japan is also going to amend " concept of basic defense force " so that military deployment overseas can be made legal and permanent . it also plans to establish a " regular force " for overseas deployment that is not formed on contingency .</seg>
<seg id=825>meanwhile , the japanese cabinet meeting , citing the so - called " threat of north korea 's missiles as a reason , decided to start the deployment of the missile defense system by early 2004 . it imports the u.s. - made " standard 3 missiles " and " patriot pac - 3 " missiles to intercept exoatmospheric missiles and those returning to the atmosphere in order to build a two - tiered missile interception network .</seg>
<seg id=826>it is easy to see that japan 's sdf is evolving into a regular military force " for offensive as well as defensive purposes . " it seems that the so - called " sdf " " exclusively for defensive purposes " is going to exist in name only .</seg>
<seg id=827>the reason why these actions by japan have drawn so much attention is mainly because these military decisions are a challenge to japans pacifist constitution .</seg>
<seg id=828>after his visit to the yasukuni shrine , koizumi defended his action in an interview with japanese reporters .</seg>
<seg id=829>his defense was self-contradictory and full of loopholes .</seg>
<seg id=830>when asked by reporters why he visited the shrine , koizumi replied : " the peace and prosperity in japan are built upon the sacrifices of the war .</seg>
<seg id=831>the purpose of my visit is to pray for peace and prosperity of japan . "</seg>
<seg id=832>we would like to ask whether koizumi 's so - called " sacrifices of the war " include class a world war ii criminals such as hideki tojo .</seg>
<seg id=833>does it mean class a war criminals also made their fundamental contribution to the peace and prosperity in the post-war japan ?</seg>
<seg id=834>some reporter asked why january 1 was chosen for his visit to the yasukuni shrine .</seg>
<seg id=835>koizumi said it is the japanese tradition to go to worship at the shrine on the first day of the new year and many people pay a visit to the shrine on this day .</seg>
<seg id=836>it is understandable that ordinary people mourn for their loved ones and friends , and many survivors clearly expressed their opinion that their visit to the shrine is only for the purpose of remembering their loved ones and friends and that they strongly oppose honoring class a war criminals at the yasukuni shrine .</seg>
<seg id=837>the chinese are a reasonable people . we have always insisted on differentiating the japanese people from a handful of militarists and the ordinary public from the right wing . ordinary people 's visit to the yasukuni shrine is not the root cause of this historical issue .</seg>
<seg id=838>in unity there is strength .</seg>
<seg id=839>this is an indisputable truth .</seg>
<seg id=840>in order to realize the grand goal of building an overall well - to - do society and accomplish the sacred mission of rejuvenating the chinese nation , we must unite all the forces that we can unite .</seg>
<seg id=841>this must be the basic starting point and the closing point for the operations of the patriotic united front and the chinese people 's political consultative conference in the new phase of this new century .</seg>
<seg id=842>we must further adhere to and perfect the system of the multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the chinese communist party , further consolidate and develop the patriotic united front , mobilize all the positive factors to the fullest extent possible , and continue to add new strength to the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .</seg>
<seg id=843>in the past year , the cppcc , with solidarity and democracy as its firm focuses , diligently performed all its due functions and played an important role in promoting the all - round economic and social development of our country and in maintaining a stable overall environment for the progress of reforms .</seg>
<seg id=844>in this new year , we hope that the cppcc will center its work around the party and the government and further its efforts in political consultation , democratic supervision , participating in politics and political discussions , promoting its fine traditions , taking full advantage of its own superiorities , conducting investigations and studies at a deeper level , and actively giving advice and proposals so as to make new and greater contribution to the building of an overall well - to - do society .</seg>
<seg id=845>from january 4 to january 6 , the 12th summit of the south asian association for regional cooperation ( saarc ) , which had been postponed for an entire year , was held in islamabad . the summit passed " framework treaty for safta , " " additional protocol to saarc anti-terrorism convention , " " south asia social charter " and other documents , declaring the commitment of saarc member nations to the common development and cooperation in economic , cultural and anti-terrorism and other fields .</seg>
<seg id=846>during the saarc summit , the bilateral meeting between indian prime minister vajpayee and pakistani president musharraf drew special attention .</seg>
<seg id=847>the handshake at the last summit between musharraf and vajpayee did not bring too much expectation on the development of relations between the two countries .</seg>
<seg id=848>two years later , as both sides took a series of major steps such as restoration of normal diplomatic relations , air and land transport links , and the successful cease - fire in the kashmir region , the relations between india and pakistan continued to ease and this eventually led to the top - level meeting at this saarc summit .</seg>
<seg id=849>as the two countries took another major step toward improving bilateral relations , the cooperation in south asia is arriving at the new turning point for development .</seg>
<seg id=850>although indian foreign minister sinha said on the 4th that this meeting was for courtesy ,  people believe the meeting means the india - pakistan relations will continue to be adjusted toward a more positive and pragmatic direction .</seg>
<seg id=851>the leaders of the two countries have both realized that tension and confrontation go against the interests of their own respective country and only make them lose one opportunity after another in economic development .</seg>
<seg id=852>with further development in globalization , strengthening the cooperation and revitalizing the economy have now become top priorities for the governments of both countries .</seg>
<seg id=853>although the result of the presidential election held on the 4th in georgia has not yet been officially announced , the victory of saakashvili , the national movement leader who is a candidate jointly nominated by the right - wing political parties , is a foregone conclusion .</seg>
<seg id=854>georgia 's central election commission announced on the 7th that based on the statistics of 89% of votes , more than 95% of voters supported saakashvili .</seg>
<seg id=855>some heads of state from the commonwealth of independent states have also sent messages of congratulation to this young politician .</seg>
<seg id=856>in fact , saakashvili already declared his own victory as early as the very night after the election was over .</seg>
<seg id=857>he called the result " the victory of the people , " and said that georgia will act promptly to create a new future .</seg>
<seg id=858>when interviewed by the news media , many voters said that casting votes for saakashvili means choosing " a new hope . "</seg>
<seg id=859>even the former president shevardnadze who was forced to resign also expressed his support for this former political opponent by praising him as " young , energetic and well - educated . "</seg>
<seg id=860>while placing their hope on saakashvili , people also noticed that not many changes have taken place in georgia in the two months since shevardnadze resigned .</seg>
<seg id=861>in other words , what the president - elect has to face will still be the old problems .</seg>
<seg id=862>the past year was a significant and extraordinary one in the development of our country .</seg>
<seg id=863>we fought an extremely tough battle against the sudden epidemic of sars and won a brilliant victory for that phase . meanwhile , our economic development has maintained its excellent momentum and the average gdp per capita reached a new level of over 1,000 u.s. dollars . with the success of shenzhou 5 manned space flight , the dream of space flight by the chinese nation has become a reality . we have enjoyed ethnic solidarity and social progress and peoples livelihood is further improving .</seg>
<seg id=864>the achievements made by our country in various fields are widely noticed by the world . for these achievements , the people of the whole country have contributed a great deal of work , demonstrating their fearlessness for hardships and risks , and courage and strength to create miracles .</seg>
<seg id=865>we are full of confidence and hope for the new year .</seg>
<seg id=866>the current situation both in china and abroad offers our country an important strategic opportunity that we must grasp for great accomplishments .</seg>
<seg id=867>we will continue to use deng xiaoping theory and the important thought of three represents as our guideline and fully implement the spirit of the party 's 16th congress and the 3rd plenary session of the 16th cpc central committee . we must conscientiously carry out the general guidelines and overall deployment set forth by the central party committee on this years work and continue to push forward the reform and opening up as well as the modernization drive .</seg>
<seg id=868>to do a good job for this year , we should make a correct assessment of the situation by identifying both favorable conditions and new opportunities on the one hand and unfavorable conditions and new challenges on the other . we should also heighten our sense of responsibility and urgency and awareness of potential adversities .</seg>
<seg id=869>the three - party talks on issues of iraq were held on the 19th in the un headquarters in new york city . annan , the un secretary general , held discussions with representatives from iraq 's interim governing council and the u.s. - british coalition provisional authority with the focus on how the united nations can play its role in rebuilding iraq .</seg>
<seg id=870>the talks covered such issues as politics , humanitarian aids , security in iraq and the appointment of the un special representative to iraq , upon which the three parties exchanged their opinions in a candid manner .</seg>
<seg id=871>at a time when the u.s. - british plan of transfer of power to iraq is facing boycott , whether or how the united nations will get involved in rebuilding iraq certainly draws much attention .</seg>
<seg id=872>since the united states declared the end of major combat in iraq in early may last year , the situation in iraq has remained precarious . attacks against the occupation forces were frequent , inflicting heavy casualties on the u.s. - british coalition forces that have enjoyed little lull of peace .</seg>
<seg id=873>the former iraqi president saddam was captured on december 13 last year , but the u.s. euphoria did not last long . security remained unimproved and resistance escalated , throwing the occupying authority into a dilemma .</seg>
<seg id=874>on the other hand , the iraqi people and arab countries are unanimously demanding the pull - out of foreign troops and the return of power to iraqis so as to let the iraqi people govern their own country .</seg>
<seg id=875>meanwhile , the united states and britain are trying hard to reshape the iraqi government according to their own will , through which they plan to gradually and " gracefully " extricate themselves from the dilemma .</seg>
<seg id=876>therefore , the method and process of the power transfer have become the focus of the current iraqi affairs .</seg>
<seg id=877>the tentative plan of power transfer as proposed by the coalition provisional authority and iraq 's interim governing council last november is that the iraqi interim transitional government to be formed by july 1 this year will be elected by the " transitional national assembly , " but the delegates to the assembly shall be selected and appointed by " governorate selection caucuses . "</seg>
<seg id=878>whereas , the shiites that make up the majority of iraqi population stress that for a truly fair transfer of power to iraq , a national direct election should be held .</seg>
<seg id=879>u.s. secretary of state powell 's recent visit to russia remains a focus of widespread public opinion .</seg>
<seg id=880>this is partly due to the fact that the mutual relations between the united states and russia , the two decisive powers , can have profound and far - reaching impact on the present world .</seg>
<seg id=881>more importantly , powell 's visit to moscow is very substantive and sends a clear signal that dark clouds are looming over the relations between the united states and russia .</seg>
<seg id=882>if these dark clouds are not dispersed in time , the prospects of the bilateral relations may not be optimistic .</seg>
<seg id=883>despite the smooth and open channel of dialogue between washington and moscow , powell decided to clarify his position in an article in izvestia , a very influential newspaper in russia .</seg>
<seg id=884>powell pointed out in his article that the united states was puzzled by a series of events in russia 's internal affairs and diplomatic arena in recent months .</seg>
<seg id=885>in his opinion , the political power in russia is not yet fully tethered to law and the key elements of a civil society such as freedom of the press and development of political parties are not solidly established .</seg>
<seg id=886>russias policy on chechnya and its attitude toward its neighboring countries in the commonwealth of independent states have caused all the more concerns from the united states .</seg>
<seg id=887>to diplomats , using the mass media for a public statement of position is the " last resort " of communications .</seg>
<seg id=888>the original intention of the united states in making such a choice is thought - provoking as it is clear that russia is embarrassed and displeased with this choice .</seg>
<seg id=889>( international ) flu outbreak peaks in u.s.</seg>
<seg id=890>xinhua news agency , los angeles , december 31 ( reporter yan liang ) the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention said on the 31st that the worst flu in the united states in more than 30 years has peaked . widespread influenza activities have been reported in 45 of the 50 u.s. states and the number of flu deaths has rapidly risen .</seg>
<seg id=891>according to the cdc statistics as of december 20 , the number of flu deaths in the united states has hit a record high , accounting for 7.8% of all deaths during the same period .</seg>
<seg id=892>in the united states , at least 42 children have died of the flu , and the number of adult flu deaths is also rapidly rising though accurate statistics are not available at this moment .</seg>
<seg id=893>according to experts , there are two reasons why the flu became epidemic in 2003 : first , since the flu virus is not the type of " panama a " common in the past years , the vaccines manufactured earlier cannot offer effective protection against the virus ; and second , a surplus of flu vaccines last year in the united states has led two major vaccine suppliers to reduce this year 's production to 83 million doses , causing a vaccine shortage this year .</seg>
<seg id=894>although on average , 36,000 people die of the flu and 114,000 people are hospitalized with flu each year in the united states , it is rare for the flu to cause such public alarm as this year 's .</seg>
<seg id=895>according to william thompson , a u.s. epidemiologist , this flu is the worst in the united states in more than 30 years and it has also come earlier than usual . quite a number of schools have reported widespread flu activities and long lines have formed at many flu vaccination stations .</seg>
<seg id=896>in response to such serious situation , the u.s. department of health activated its emergency operations center on december 19 and dispatched teams of medical experts to all states .</seg>
<seg id=897>recently , some parts of our country were hit one after another by the epidemic of the highly pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai ) .</seg>
<seg id=898>the central party committee and the state council take the situation very seriously and have promptly made a series of major decisions , clearly setting forth the guidelines , policies and measures for prevention and control .</seg>
<seg id=899>all relevant local agencies and departments are mobilized for the emergency , and are sparing no efforts in preventing the spread of the epidemic in accordance with the plans of the party central committee and the state council .</seg>
<seg id=900>at present , the work on prevention and control of the bird flu in the entire country is being carried out in an intense but orderly manner .</seg>
<seg id=901>hpai is a type of animal epidemic that spreads fast and causes great damages . it wreaks havoc to animal husbandry and seriously threatens the health and safety of the general human population .</seg>
<seg id=902>since the effective prevention and control of hpai is linked with the health and safety of the people , the development of agriculture and additional income of peasants , the overall economic development and the social stability , all local agencies and departments must follow the important thought of " three represents " as their guideline ; and in accordance with the requirements set forth by the law on animal epidemic prevention of the people 's republic of china , they must strengthen leadership and act in closer coordination , rely on science , carry out prevention and control according to the law , mobilize the vast majority of masses for prevention and control , and handle cases in a resolute manner . taking serious responsibility for the people and effectively implementing various prevention and control measures , they are determined to win this blocking action against the bird flu .</seg>
<seg id=903>as the largest debtor country in the world , the united states has seen the increase of its foreign debt again .</seg>
<seg id=904>the u.s. department of the treasury announced on january 16 that as of the end of september last year , the debt the united states owed various types of foreign creditors hit a total of 6.494 trillion u.s. dollars , up 2.2% over the figure last released .</seg>
<seg id=905>on the average , each american owes more than 20,000 u.s. dollars in foreign debt .</seg>
<seg id=906>coincidentally , the imf had issued a study a week earlier , sending a systematic and sharp warning about the precarious u.s. financial foundation . it pointed out that the u.s. foreign debt , which keeps breaking records , has reached a level that poses a threat to the global financial stability .</seg>
<seg id=907>statistics show that private foreign investors control about 40% of the u.s. government bonds .</seg>
<seg id=908>this inevitably reminds us of keynes ' proposal to president roosevelt in the first half of the 20th century : adopting a deficit policy to stimulate economy at home while making up for the financial loss by means of foreign debt .</seg>
<seg id=909>this measure indeed played an important role in stimulating the " effective demand " to solve the impending economic crisis .</seg>
<seg id=910>however , people have noticed that many u.s. administrations tended to use it as a " miraculous cure . "</seg>
<seg id=911>but since the 1980s when president reagan advocated tax cuts and military expansion , the u.s. deficit has been climbing up and the united states eventually has become the largest debtor nation .</seg>
<seg id=912>the opening of the first round of six - nation talks was a major step toward the dialogue and peace process on the korean peninsula nuclear issue .</seg>
<seg id=913>some consensuses reached by all parties during the talks have laid the necessary groundwork for the continuation of the talks and further outlined the goals , approaches and guidelines for the solution to the korean peninsula nuclear issue .</seg>
<seg id=914>in the past few months , all parties concerned maintain that the nuclear issue on the peninsula should be peacefully solved through dialogue . based on the results of the first round of six - nation talks , they conducted extensive coordination and consultation at different levels and made untiring efforts so as to bring about the second round of talks as early as possible .</seg>
<seg id=915>in the meantime , north korea and the united states also further demonstrated some degree of flexibility .</seg>
<seg id=916>now that major progresses have been made in preparations for the talks , we all hope that we should make the talks a success .</seg>
<seg id=917>what the second round of six - nation talks can accomplish and whether the peace process can be continued are the general concerns of all parties involved and the international community .</seg>
<seg id=918>in response , the spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry said that the goal of the six - nation talks is to maintain and promote dialogue and peace process . we are willing to work jointly with all parties to achieve that goal .</seg>
<seg id=919>the basic starting point for the chinese side is to maintain peace and stability in a nuclear - free korean peninsula .</seg>
<seg id=920>the chinese side believes that as long as all parties participating in the talks uphold their sincerity in peace talks , mutual respect , and equality in consultations , they will be able to create conditions helpful for the solution to the issues concerned .</seg>
<seg id=921>the relations between the united states and libya deteriorated in the late 1970s , and the two countries severed their diplomatic ties in 1981 .</seg>
<seg id=922>u.s. president reagan once made a lengthy list of crimes for libya 's leader qaddafi , accusing libya of secretly developing nuclear weapons and engaging in external military intervention and terrorism .</seg>
<seg id=923>as the verbal attacks between the two sides escalated to military actions , the united states launched two surgical air strikes against libya called " prairie fire " and " el dorado canyon . "</seg>
<seg id=924>since then , the united states had put libya under economic sanctions , political attacks , diplomatic constraints and military threats .</seg>
<seg id=925>however , qaddafi did not give in under pressures .</seg>
<seg id=926>now seeing a thaw in the relations between the united states and libya , some people attributed it entirely to the deterrent effect of the iraq war . this seems to be rather biased .</seg>
<seg id=927>in fact , qaddafi , a man of extraordinary character , has been waving the olive branch to the united states over the years all along while he is engaged in the fight against the country . it is only a pity that he has n't got any response .</seg>
<seg id=928>after the war in iraq was over , all parties in the middle east readjusted their strategies and regional forces were reorganized . this has provided a turning point for the restoration of diplomatic ties between the united states and libya .</seg>
<seg id=929>to qaddafi , the restoration of friendly ties with the united states can end sanctions , rejuvenate economy , improve people 's life , and get his country out of isolation into integration with the international community .</seg>
<seg id=930>by giving up what it has n't got and may not be able to get for some time , libya can find a silver lining in an entirely new situation in return .</seg>
<seg id=931>from february 7 to february 8 , top politicians in europe , the united states and the rest of the world gathered in munich , germany , to attend the 40th munich conference on security policy .</seg>
<seg id=932>the so - called " munich conference on security policy " is an international forum on security founded by a non-government individual and funded by the german government . in recent years , it has gained increasing attention especially after the sept .11 attacks and has been honored as the " davos forum " on security .</seg>
<seg id=933>one of the major topics for the conference this time is transatlantic relations .</seg>
<seg id=934>the remarks by the top european and u.s. politicians either at the conference or outside the conference showed that both sides are trying their best to get rid of the dark shadow that the iraq war has brought over their relations and are making every effort to resume their cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=935>bertram , director of the german institute for international politics and security in berlin , said that this was a meeting for the united states and europe to repair their relations as both sides had the desire to get closer again .</seg>
<seg id=936>the new message from the conference regarding the european and u.s. relations is that europe and the united states need to restart the dialogue . they should seriously consider the common tasks both face and find the convergence of interests needed for the accomplishment of these common tasks .</seg>
<seg id=937>compared with the conference last year , there was no sign of belligerence at this year 's conference . both parties are moving closer in their positions .</seg>
<seg id=938>although " old europe " represented by france and germany was still resentful about the u.s. war on iraq , it agreed to " look forward . "</seg>
<seg id=939>fischer , the german foreign minister , said at the conference : although we hold different views about the war , we must jointly ensure peace in post-war iraq . for that reason we must look forward .</seg>
<seg id=940>he added that germany will not hinder the nato from playing a direct role in iraq though it will not send troops to iraq .</seg>
<seg id=941>the united states has the most advanced modern media and monopolizes a substantial part of international press . the extent of its propaganda has long reached every corner of the world and has virtually become ubiquitous . why does it want to spend huge investment now in setting up a satellite television network that covers specifically the 22 countries across the middle east ?</seg>
<seg id=942>quoting the head of " alhurra " tv station , it is to provide arab countries a news platform of " comprehensive and fair viewpoints . "</seg>
<seg id=943>however , some analysts pointed out that " alhurra " will be the strategic weapon used by the united states to carry out media infiltration , cultural invasion and psychological warfare in arab countries . it is an important propaganda tool for the united states to implement its policy of restructuring the middle east and reforming the islamic world .</seg>
<seg id=944>in that sense , " alhurra " has an extraordinary mission which chiefly consists of three major points . the first is to spread " the concept of freedom . "</seg>
<seg id=945>the united states considers the islamic civilization a serious hurdle to the promotion of the modern western civilization . the religious extremist forces in the islamic countries in the middle east are the breeding ground for the international terrorism that has a distinctive feature of anti-americanism . in order to effectively combat terrorism , the islamic world must be reformed so that it will identify with and accept the western values , style of life and political system .</seg>
<seg id=946>through the subtle influence of " alhurra " programs , the united states attempts to instill its own ideology in arabs .</seg>
<seg id=947>the second is to improve the u.s. image .</seg>
<seg id=948>externally , the united states adopts unilateralism and acts like a bully in whatever way it wants on many international issues . such hegemony has infuriated the arab countries and islamic world .</seg>
<seg id=949>after the sept .11 attacks , the conflict escalated between the united states that has persistently favored israel and the islamic world in the middle east .</seg>
<seg id=950>without any verified evidence and the un authorization , the united states invaded iraq by force under the pretext of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and counter - terrorism , arousing strong revulsion from the muslim community .</seg>
<seg id=951>as the talks between pakistani and indian officials were held in islamabad from february 16 to february 18 , the hope of peace is rekindled across the south asia subcontinent .</seg>
<seg id=952>the officials from the two countries set the schedule and mode of talks for the future and established the mechanism for continuous dialogue . this move marks the resumption of the pakistani - indian dialogue two years after it broke off , and lays the foundation for the two countries to gradually solve all those pending issues including the kashmir dispute . it is a demonstration of the precious sincerity for peace on both sides .</seg>
<seg id=953>prior to this meeting , most analysts were still cautious about the prospects of peace process though the relations between the two countries are thawing at a series of goodwill gestures from both sides , .</seg>
<seg id=954>that is understandable . the memory of turbulent ups and downs in the pakistani - indian relations in recent years seems too fresh for anyone to guarantee that the sunshine upon the negotiation table today would not change into a thunderstorm over the borders tomorrow .</seg>
<seg id=955>however , when pakistan 's foreign affairs secretary riaz khokhar , with a smile on his face , read the statement by the two countries on the 18th , optimism indeed prevailed and sent new hopes to many people who have been long concerned with the situation in south asia .</seg>
<seg id=956>first , the timetable set by this meeting is highly operative . both parties not only confirmed the specific time and topics for the meeting but also decided on the different levels of meeting in accordance with the degree of importance of the topics .</seg>
<seg id=957>second , both parties learned the lesson from the accra summit in july 2001 when the direct dialogue between the leaders of the two countries ended in failure and adopted " a step - by - step " dialogue approach , starting the dialogue from the low level upward so that full preparations will be made for the dialogue of higher level .</seg>
<seg id=958>furthermore , after experiencing a series of ebb and flow of the bilateral relations , both countries agree that war is not a good solution to disputes and that both should stay away from war . this consensus has laid the foundation for the leaders of both countries to reach a common understanding in future that " there will never be another war between india and pakistan . "</seg>
<seg id=959>in order to completely and accurately understand and implement the principle of " one country , two systems , " we must integrate " one country " with " two systems " and " love of the nation " with " love of hong kong . " we must both respect hong kong 's high degree of autonomy and safeguard our country 's sovereignty . and we must retain the capitalism in hong kong while adhering to socialism in the main body of our country .</seg>
<seg id=960>only by doing this can we effectively safeguard the blessings of hong kong compatriots and meet the long - term interests of our country and entire people .</seg>
<seg id=961>since the return of hong kong , the central government has firmly implemented the principle of " one country , two systems " and strictly observed the " basic law . "</seg>
<seg id=962>the vast majority of hong kong compatriots , as their own masters , have enjoyed unprecedented democratic rights .</seg>
<seg id=963>with the strong support by the central government and the mainland , hong kong has overcome various risks and challenges such as the asian financial crisis and continued to maintain its position as an international financial , trade and shipping center .</seg>
<seg id=964>our practice has proved that " the principle of " one country , two systems " has strong vitality .</seg>
<seg id=965>today the republication of comrade deng xiaoping 's speech two decades ago demonstrated to the world again the firm determination of the central government in implementing the principle of " one country , two systems . " moreover , it serves to give everyone a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the principle of " one country , two systems " so that the great practice of this principle will be continuously pressed ahead .</seg>
<seg id=966>today , the central party committee and the state council held a grand ceremony here for china 's state science and technology award .</seg>
<seg id=967>president hu jintao presented the award certificates to the 2003 state top science and technology award winners , academicians liu dongsheng and wang yongzhi .</seg>
<seg id=968>the conference presented certificates to china 's manned space project that wins the state scientific and technological progress special award and to the scientists who win the 2003 state natural science award , the state technological invention award and the state scientific and technological progress award .</seg>
<seg id=969>on behalf of the central party committee and the state council , i hereby give my warm congratulation to all the winners !</seg>
<seg id=970>i hereby give my sincerest greeting and highest respect to the scientific and technological personnel in all fields in the country !</seg>
<seg id=971>to our country , the first two decades of this century mean an important strategic period that we must grasp firmly for great accomplishments .</seg>
<seg id=972>we must concentrate on building an overall well - to - do society of higher level that will benefit billions of people .</seg>
<seg id=973>to take full advantage of this strategic period and strive for achievements , we must attach greater importance and prominence to the development of science and technology .</seg>
<seg id=974>after the sept . 11 attacks , u.s. president bush proposed the " preemptive strategy " in june 2002 and put it into practice in u.s. foreign affairs . in march last year , the first preemptive war was fought in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=975>the concept of " preemption " is not only inconsistent with the guideline of the international law that is centered on " mutual respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity " but also will surely trigger the dangerous copycat effect , threatening the international order with new turmoils .</seg>
<seg id=976>when the " preemptive " theory was first proposed , some prominent u.s. politicians asked the question : " what if other countries all follow the example ? "</seg>
<seg id=977>just as they expected , more and more countries claimed that they also want to go " preemptive " in the recent two years and their number is growing .</seg>
<seg id=978>this is a new trend that warrants attention and study .</seg>
<seg id=979>in the very month when bush proposed " the preemptive strategy , " australian prime minister howard was the first one to stand up and show his support .</seg>
<seg id=980>he said that australia would adopt " preemptive " tactics and have no scruples about taking military actions in the neighboring countries once it received any confirmed intelligence that terrorists were to attack australia .</seg>
<seg id=981>he even proposed that the principle of " preemption " be written into the un charter as he considered it necessary to amend the un charter so as to give all nations " preemptive " rights to fight terrorists or countries that support terrorism .</seg>
<seg id=982>in northeast asia , japan 's defense agency proposed long ago in the white paper on defense released in july 1999 that japan could launch " preemptive " strikes on foreign bases prior to missile attacks or military invasion .</seg>
<seg id=983>after the war in iraq , japan became even more unscrupulous in its advocacy of the " preemptive " strategy .</seg>
<seg id=984>recently , there have been quite many international comments on the current u.s. africa policy .</seg>
<seg id=985>in this year 's january issue of " foreign policy in focus , " a u.s. magazine , there is an article entitled " africa policy outlook 2004 . " according to this article , the foreign policy of the bush administration in the past year has directly or indirectly brought negative impact on africa . in particular , the u.s. preoccupation with the war on terror and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , and especially the u.s. presence in iraq have greatly diluted its attention to africa .</seg>
<seg id=986>people still remember that in order to show its concern for africa , the bush administration set forth a " president 's emergency plan for aids relief " in january last year and promised to provide at least 3 billion u.s. dollars each year to africa .</seg>
<seg id=987>in july last year , president bush successively visited five african countries of senegal , south africa , botswana , uganda and nigeria and pledged 15 billion u.s. dollars in assisting african countries in their prevention and treatment of aids and another 100 million u.s. dollars for fighting terrorist activities in africa . other africa aid programs such as food emergency program and education assistance program were also announced .</seg>
<seg id=988>these aid programs were once greatly welcomed by african countries and won quite a lot of international acclaim .</seg>
<seg id=989>however , one year has passed without any sign of concrete fulfilment by the united states .</seg>
<seg id=990>africa is in urgent need of assistance .</seg>
<seg id=991>entering the new century , africa faces a host of challenges in its development all the more . in order to realize the " millennium development goals " set forth by the united nations in 2000 , work hard to reduce hunger and poverty , and promote health and education , africa founded the " african union " to take overall charge of african affairs and established " the new partnership for africa 's development " aimed at promoting development in all countries . however , due to poor financial resources , lack of development funds has always been a problem .</seg>
<seg id=992>the united nations has repeatedly called for the developed countries to allocate 0.7% of their gnp to be used as official aid to the most underdeveloped countries .</seg>
<seg id=993>however , with its official aid only accounting for 0.1% of its gnp , the united states has far failed the un requirement and ranked at the bottom of the list of donor countries .</seg>
<seg id=994>recently , the european media has been discussing a hot topic : whether the " big three " summit of german chancellor schoder , french president chirac and british prime minister blair is gradually institutionalized .</seg>
<seg id=995>the media calls the " big three " of germany , france and britain the eu 's " new troika " and the relations among the three countries the " new triangular relations . "</seg>
<seg id=996>the " new triangle " is a new phenomenon . it remains to be observed as to where it is going . however , no matter from what perspective , the " new triangle " overall seems to be conducive to the unification of europe and therefore will help europe to play an important role as one pole of the multi-polar world in the international arena .</seg>
<seg id=997>a survey of european history of a hundred years shows that the triangular relations among germany , france and britain have one basic characteristic : the alliance between britain and france in controlling or opposing germany .</seg>
<seg id=998>two world wars are the proofs .</seg>
<seg id=999>in the era of cold war , both east germany and west germany were respectively constrained by warshaw convention and north atlantic treaty organization .</seg>
<seg id=1000>after the cold war ended , the unified germany became even more powerful , causing an imbalance of power in west europe . the growing suspicion of france led to the temporary malfunctioning of germany - france axis . as a result , britain and france got close again with the same old intention of controlling germany .</seg>
<seg id=1001>however , with " germany - france axis " back into operation and the fierce conflict between the concepts of the unipolarization and multipolarization of the world , the eu has become seriously divided internally on the issue of iraq in recent years .</seg>
<seg id=1002>the " old europe " represented by germany and france holds exactly the opposite position from that of " new europe " represented by britain and poland on the issue of the iraq war .</seg>
<seg id=1003>furthermore , the split happens to occur exactly at a time when the eu is going to have the largest expansion in its history .</seg>
<seg id=1004>egyptian president mubarak recently made a speech on the reforms in arab countries in cairo and criticized the outside world for imposing an uniform mode of reform on arab countries . he warned that such attempt could only get the opposite results and would do no good to the security and stability in the middle east .</seg>
<seg id=1005>in his opinion , the reform measures should be based on individual characteristics and depend on resources available , while the uniform mode of reform ignores the cultural backgrounds , social customs and religious features of different countries .</seg>
<seg id=1006>at the same time , he also pointed out that arab countries welcome outside help in the process of their reforms , but these efforts must fully recognize the different national conditions and respect the wishes of different countries so as to promote the reforms in political , economic and cultural areas in arab countries .</seg>
<seg id=1007>the egyptian leader 's speech represented the common view of arab countries .</seg>
<seg id=1008>under the current pressures of fighting against terrorism , preventing proliferation and conducting democratic reforms , the middle east , as one of the hot spots in the world , is brewing new turmoil that will lead to new reorganization .</seg>
<seg id=1009>after experiencing the two wars in afghanistan and iraq , how will iraq , once considered one of the " axis of evil " countries by the united states , carry out political reconstruction ?</seg>
<seg id=1010>how will various kinds of political systems and social modes in the middle east evolve ?</seg>
<seg id=1011>this is not only the concern of the arab world and the international community , but more than that , it is also something that the united states and its western allies are interested in .</seg>
<seg id=1012>after his meeting with visiting bahrain 's crown prince salman on the 9th in washington , u.s. secretary of state powell reiterated that the united states wants to promote the " plan of western democracy and capitalism " in iraq and the middle east .</seg>
<seg id=1013>he also stressed : " we are thinking about what else we can do and how we can institutionalize them . "</seg>
<seg id=1014>last year was the year designated by the international olympic committee as the year of " culture and education . "</seg>
<seg id=1015>beijing organizing committee of the olympic games ( bocog ) took this good opportunity to hold a series of educational activities that promote advanced culture and popularize the olympic knowledge .</seg>
<seg id=1016>among them , the publication of the " secondary school olympic reader " chiefly for youth readership is one of the most important achievements .</seg>
<seg id=1017>the book , rich both in illustration and text , provides a systematic and vivid introduction of the olympic movement and the essence of the olympic spirit mainly through story telling . it serves as good teaching materials that will help enhance young students ' understanding of the olympic movement and increase the society 's enthusiasm for participation in the olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=1018>last year , bocog also designed a schedule of classes specially for young students that is printed on recycled paper with the logo of beijing olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=1019>the concept of " green olympics " means that olympic games should be prepared and held under the guideline of sustainable development such as protecting the environment and ecological balance .</seg>
<seg id=1020>we hope these schedules of classes will regulate students ' behavior just as they set the schedules for classes and will gradually make them practitioners and advocators of the concept of " green olympics . "</seg>
<seg id=1021>education is one of the core components of the olympic movement . it is also an important embodiment of " civilized olympics . "</seg>
<seg id=1022>the real objective of olympics is to educate young people with a new approach and from a new perspective and promote the harmonious development of both psychological and physical well - beings so that they will make contributions to building a peaceful and beautiful world .</seg>
<seg id=1023>therefore , the combination of sports and education not only opens up a new world for the development of education but also makes the olympic movement more educational .</seg>
<seg id=1024>" green olympics " is one of the three concepts that beijing upholds in hosting the 2008 olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=1025>it basically means to significantly enhance the environmental quality of the capital , create a beautiful environment for the olympic games and build an ecologically - friendly city .</seg>
<seg id=1026>to achieve these goals , we must extensively adopt environmental protection technologies and measures , proceed with a large - scale environmental treatment in various aspects and with afforestation and beautification of urban and rural areas , and promote the development of the environmental protection industry . we must constantly raise public awareness of environmental protection and encourage everyone to actively participate in various activities aimed to improve the ecological environment .</seg>
<seg id=1027>to effectively implement " a green olympics " is an important task for us to carry out the 3rd plenary session of the 16th cpc central committee 's proposal of adhering to the people - based principle and establishing the scientific viewpoint of comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable development , and to promote a comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable economic and social development of the city of beijing .</seg>
<seg id=1028>we must lay great emphasis on this .</seg>
<seg id=1029>in order to realize the goal of a green olympics , beijing municipality has formulated an " olympic action plan " and " ecosystem and environment protection plan " based on the " tenth five - year plan " and the " bid proposal " and set forth new goals and plans for environmental construction and protection in the next few years .</seg>
<seg id=1030>the goal of hosting a green olympics will be fully realized through planning and step - by - step implementation .</seg>
<seg id=1031>on february 25 , the u.s. department of state released its " 2003 country reports on human rights practices " and is again finding fault with the human rights conditions in more than 190 countries and regions including china . assuming the tone of a " headmaster , " it labeled many countries as having poor human rights conditions , failing to meet u.s. standards , as bad as could be , while claiming some countries backslided in key human rights areas , and so on and so forth .</seg>
<seg id=1032>of course , there are still some countries that have seen great improvements in their human rights conditions , such as afghanistan and iraq , but these are the " achievements " of the u.s. military in overthrowing the former regimes and " liberating " the two countries .</seg>
<seg id=1033>yet how about the human rights conditions in the united states ?</seg>
<seg id=1034>just as in previous years , the report made no comment .</seg>
<seg id=1035>to make up for the lack of report on the u.s. human rights conditions , the information office of china 's state council released " the human rights record of the united states in 2003 " on march 1 .</seg>
<seg id=1036>citing a large quantity of factual evidence , the article presents many human rights problems in the united states and the u.s. infringement upon human rights of other countries .</seg>
<seg id=1037>americans historically have a tradition of honesty and admitting mistakes made .</seg>
<seg id=1038>the well - known story about young george washington cutting the cherry tree is a vivid example .</seg>
<seg id=1039>now that it has become the only superpower in the world , the united states , on the contrary , seldom speaks the truth .</seg>
<seg id=1040>recently , some change has quietly taken place in the coverage of china 's economic development by japan 's mainstream media .</seg>
<seg id=1041>contrary to the previous " china threat theory , " many media reports in japan now start to hold the opinion that the economic development of china has promoted the economic recovery of japan and that the demand of the thriving chinese market has become an important drive for japan 's economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1042>an article recently carried in the u.s. newsweek also said that the rise of china is more an opportunity than a threat to other countries , especially to its neighboring countries .</seg>
<seg id=1043>the once widespread " china threat theory " is now being replaced by a " china opportunity theory . "</seg>
<seg id=1044>the " china threat theory " asserts that the development of china will pose a threat to other countries , especially its neighboring countries .</seg>
<seg id=1045>however , this assertion aimed at sowing discord is not accepted by china 's neighboring countries .</seg>
<seg id=1046>former malaysian president mahathir once stated directly : " asian countries have no need to fear china 's growing military and economic power because china does not have the tradition of invading foreign countries . "</seg>
<seg id=1047>in a published long - term plan , the indian defense ministry also maintains that china poses no military threat to india .</seg>
<seg id=1048>in economic and trade fields , the governments and corporations of various countries all consider china their best choice for market expansion . overseas investors with strategic visions are firmly validating the " china opportunity theory " through their actions : of the fortune 500 in the world , more than 400 have come to invest in china .</seg>
<seg id=1049>over past consecutive years , china has topped the world in foreign investment attraction .</seg>
<seg id=1050>gdp is a globally accepted important macroeconomic indicator .</seg>
<seg id=1051>it is of crucial importance to maintain the growth of gdp throughout the entire process of our country 's modernization .</seg>
<seg id=1052>for the simple reason that an increase of one percentage point from the current gdp of our country can result in more than 800,000 jobs , we all must maintain the momentum of rapid economic growth .</seg>
<seg id=1053>to realize the grand goal of building an overall well - to - do society and the third - phase strategic goal of modernization depends very much on the sustained rapid growth of gdp .</seg>
<seg id=1054>however , we should see that gdp , as an indicator , has its own flaw .</seg>
<seg id=1055>for example , it cannot easily reflect the quality and composition of economic growth accurately , cannot easily reflect the actual level of social welfare people enjoy , nor can it measure accurately the social distribution and social fairness , and so on .</seg>
<seg id=1056>on the other hand , gdp is not the only indicator .</seg>
<seg id=1057>our assessment of political performance shall not look at the growth of gdp alone . we shall also look at the actual material and cultural life of the general public . we will look at the employment situation , social security and even social justice , social order , social management , social harmony , etc. in the area .</seg>
<seg id=1058>therefore , we must treat the existing gdp verification system scientifically both in thinking and approaches and find the right place for gdp in the entire economic and social development .</seg>
<seg id=1059>we must maintain some level of its growth rate , but at the same time we should not overvalue it . and we should certainly not exclusively and purposely seek after it .</seg>
<seg id=1060>since the security council delegation visited the six west african countries at the end of june last year , the overall situation in the entire region has seen encouraging changes , though the situation in a few countries turned back to turmoil for a time .</seg>
<seg id=1061>we are pleased to see that the government of sierra leone is making positive progress in enhancing the capabilities of its army and police and in stepping up control of the country 's diamonds and preparing for the election of local governments . the un special delegation to sierra leone is also gradually scaling down according to the original schedule .</seg>
<seg id=1062>equally encouraging is that with the deployment of the un special delegation to liberia , liberia is gradually walking out of the turmoil brought by protracted wars and starting to embark on the road to recovery and reconstruction .</seg>
<seg id=1063>the political process in guinea - bissau has also made positive progress . the transitional government has promised to hold the legislative election in march this year .</seg>
<seg id=1064>the peace process in cote diviore took a turn for the better again after suffering a few setbacks . all parties have promised to implement the linas - marcoussis accord . " the new forces " announced its return to the government of national reconciliation and the security council is studying its plan to dispatch peacekeeping missions .</seg>
<seg id=1065>we expect that the security council will make the decision as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=1066>the secretariat , ecowas and other relevant parties also worked hard to solve cross - border issues such as salw trafficking , mercenary activities and recruitment of child soldiers from the perspective of the region and have achieved positive results .</seg>
<seg id=1067>while fully affirming the aforementioned progresses , we should realize that the overall situation in west africa is in a way still precarious . due to geo - political and historical reasons in particular , the countries in the region are closely linked and mutually influential . the turmoil in one country often affects the neighboring countries and even the entire region .</seg>
<seg id=1068>therefore , just as proposed in the security council report , the international community , including the security council , must stick to a comprehensive and overall strategy in solving the issues in west africa , and spare no efforts to tackle the cross - border issues . in the meantime , it must actively assist the countries concerned , the regional or sub-regional organizations such as the au and ecowas and strengthen their capabilities to prevent and solve conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1069>we share a common understanding that children are the future of the world .</seg>
<seg id=1070>we have the obligation to create the best and most suitable conditions to benefit their life , study , growth , maturity and success .</seg>
<seg id=1071>however , it is regrettable that thousands of children in the world today are still victimized by armed conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1072>what they have experienced is turmoil and backwardness ; what they have seen is violence and destruction ; what they suffer is injuries and abuses ; and what they feel is sadness and helplessness .</seg>
<seg id=1073>therefore , it is an important obligation of the international community to protect children from being harmed by armed conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1074>all countries , especially those involved in the conflicts , should make their utmost efforts toward this goal .</seg>
<seg id=1075>we are pleased to see that in recent years the united nations has taken a series of measures in promoting the protection of children caught in armed conflicts and has achieved positive results .</seg>
<seg id=1076>the security council passed in succession the four resolutions of no .1261 ( 1999 ) , no .1314 ( 2000 ) , no .1379 ( 2001 ) and no .1460 ( 2003 ) , which provide the important framework for protection of children .</seg>
<seg id=1077>the peacekeeping missions deployed by the united nations in some regions regard the protection of children as an important task , which includes appointing child protection advisors and taking full consideration of children 's special needs when they assist the host countries in carrying out programs of disarmament , demobilization and social reintegration .</seg>
<seg id=1078>some peace accords promoted by the united nations or reached through the un involvement also include a clause on child protection .</seg>
<seg id=1079>national reconciliation is an important condition for establishing long - lasting peace and stability in post-conflict regions .</seg>
<seg id=1080>after the conflict is ended , if the parties involved cannot bury the hatchet , it will be hard to truly consolidate the peace and the fire of conflict may even be rekindled .</seg>
<seg id=1081>under many circumstances , to bring about post-conflict national reconciliation needs the joint efforts of all parties involved . at the same time it also needs the support and assistance of the international community , especially the united nations .</seg>
<seg id=1082>for many years , the united nations has played a useful role in helping and promoting post-conflict national reconciliation process and has accumulated a great deal of experience . generally speaking , we believe , in order to successfully assist the post-conflict countries to achieve national reconciliation , the united nations must properly handle the following three major relationships .</seg>
<seg id=1083>it must give consideration to the relationship between immediate needs and long - term goals .</seg>
<seg id=1084>national reconciliation usually takes a certain period of process and may not be accomplished in a single move .</seg>
<seg id=1085>different phases require different focuses .</seg>
<seg id=1086>the first effort at national reconciliation is to get the former belligerents to bid " farewell to arms " and create a safe environment .</seg>
<seg id=1087>during this phase , it is very important that efforts should be made to disarm and demobilize the former belligerents and reintegrate them into the community .</seg>
<seg id=1088>we are pleased to see that the situation in bosnia and herzegovina is getting stabilized ; ethnic relations are further eased ; initial success has been achieved in economic reconstruction ; the return of refugees has basically completed ; and its relations with neighboring countries is improving .</seg>
<seg id=1089>we are very much gratified about these hard won achievements in the peace process in bosnia and herzegovina .</seg>
<seg id=1090>we hereby express our congratulation on the government of bosnia and herzegovina and its people and sincerely hope that all parties in bosnia and herzegovina will continue their efforts to further strengthen mutual trust and cooperation and move forward with the peace process .</seg>
<seg id=1091>at the same time , we 've also noticed that the government agencies and their capabilities in bosnia and herzegovina still need further improvement . the reforms , especially in the judiciary and police , are still faced with challenges .</seg>
<seg id=1092>we think it is appropriate for high representatives to focus their work on this area for the first half of this year and we support the government of bosnia and herzegovina in its active cooperation with high representatives .</seg>
<seg id=1093>we believe that with the help of the international community , the people of bosnia and herzegovina will continue to make new achievements in meeting the challenge of building their own country and embark on the road to autonomous development as soon as possible , which will lead to its successful integration with europe .</seg>
<seg id=1094>the peace and stability in bosnia and herzegovina are of great significance to the realization of lasting peace and development in the region .</seg>
<seg id=1095>the chinese side has been watching closely the development of the situation in bosnia and herzegovina . together with the international community , it will continue to make its contribution in assisting bosnia and herzegovina to achieve long - term security and economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1096>china appreciates the efforts of the counter - terrorism committee to promote the implementation of the resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) in all states and to help enhance the anti-terrorist capabilities of developing countries . it supports the ctc for strengthening its coordination and cooperation with the relevant international , regional and sub-regional organizations in the global war on terror .</seg>
<seg id=1097>at the same time , we hope that the ctc will step up anti-terrorist assistance and work hard to meet the actual needs of developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=1098>at present , the issue of rejuvenating the ctc has drawn the concern of most member states .</seg>
<seg id=1099>after many consultations , the ctc put forward an official report and distributed it as a security council document .</seg>
<seg id=1100>after more than two years of operation , the existing composition and mode of operation of the ctc indeed showed some deficiencies . for instance , member states were overloaded with reports , meetings and excessive paperwork ; working efficiency needs improvement ; and there is not sufficient coordination among the experts .</seg>
<seg id=1101>therefore , we fully support the necessary reform of the ctc . we agree with the package plan proposed by the report about the establishment of a ctc executive directorate and others . and we also hope that all these existing problems can be properly solved as soon as possible , especially the problem of member states being overloaded with reports .</seg>
<seg id=1102>what i want to stress here is that rejuvenation and reform are an ongoing process . no matter what kind of reform is done , the ctc should always maintain its guidance and direction over the work of the executive directorate with regard to policies . any policy making decision should all be made through consensus reached by consultations with the plenary of the ctc .</seg>
<seg id=1103>in recent years , the issue of salw has drawn the close attention of the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1104>this shows that all parties have increasingly realized the damage the proliferation and illicit trafficking of salw have caused to the stability , post-war reconstruction and social development in the regions and countries concerned .</seg>
<seg id=1105>fortunately , the united nations has taken a series of effective actions to solve this issue .</seg>
<seg id=1106>in 2001 , the " firearms protocol " to the " un convention against transnational organized crime " and the un salw " program of action " were reached in succession .</seg>
<seg id=1107>they provide the legal and policy basis for proper settlement of the salw issue and demonstrate the determination of the international community in cracking down the illicit trade of salw .</seg>
<seg id=1108>in the past three years , great progress has been made in bringing " firearms protocol " into effect and implementing the " program of action . " the success of the united nations ' first biennial meeting on salw held in 2003 , in particular , has provided a new impetus to continuing the comprehensive and effective implementation of the " program of action . "</seg>
<seg id=1109>the resolution 58/241 passed by this general assembly has decided that a working group be established to negotiate on an international document to identify and trace illicit salw . this doubtlessly will further stimulate international efforts to combat the illicit trade of salw .</seg>
<seg id=1110>likewise , the security council has also placed increasing emphasis on the salw issue and has conducted several special reviews and passed relevant chairman 's statements and resolutions .</seg>
<seg id=1111>apart from that , the security council consistently emphasizes the importance of settling the salw issue during its deliberation on a number of issues concerning protection of civilians , women and children in armed conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1112>economic development and poverty eradication are the basic prerequisites for ensuring sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1113>the sustainable development of economy is the material basis for environmental protection and all - round social progress .</seg>
<seg id=1114>without solution to the issue of subsistence , there will be no development to speak of , let alone sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1115>to promote economic development and strive to eliminate poverty are the necessary steps that developing countries must take to achieve sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1116>without solution to the issue of poverty in developing countries , the developed countries will find it hard to sustain their own development .</seg>
<seg id=1117>to use the resources rationally and to protect the environment are the necessary requirements for achieving sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1118>it is impossible for the development to sustain itself if it is achieved at the expense of squandering resources and ruining the environment .</seg>
<seg id=1119>natural resources are not inexhaustible , yet the demand of human development continues to grow . if the relationship between the two is not properly handled , it will inevitably result in the deterioration of the ecosystem , which will seriously threaten the survival and development of mankind .</seg>
<seg id=1120>only by adopting a recycling economy that is based on the most efficient use of resources and the protection of the environment can we achieve sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1121>to achieve all - round social progress and enhance the quality of people 's life are the ultimate goals of sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1122>my memory of the 9th informal apec summit held a year ago by the huangpu river in shanghai still remains vivid .</seg>
<seg id=1123>today , we gather at the picturesque los cabos at this side of the pacific to discuss important plans of economic cooperation in the asia pacific region .</seg>
<seg id=1124>we are overjoyed to meet with our old friends .</seg>
<seg id=1125>i 'd like to take this opportunity to express my heart - felt thanks to president fox for his gracious invitation and to the mexican government for its meticulous arrangements .</seg>
<seg id=1126>in the past year , the continuous development of economic globalization and the rapid progress in science and technology have brought new opportunities for development for all countries .</seg>
<seg id=1127>in the meantime , the increased uncertainties in the world economic development have also posed new challenges to some countries and regions including the apec members in their economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1128>with trade protectionism on the rise again , there is still a long way to go to achieve free , fair and equitable trade .</seg>
<seg id=1129>the fight against terror is arduous and complicated as non-traditional security threats have increased .</seg>
<seg id=1130>the world we live in is still not a peaceful one .</seg>
<seg id=1131>although the international community faces a host of problems and other more may pop up unexpectedly in future , the ongoing trend of peace and development is not to be reversed , and the aspiration of the people of all countries for a better life remains unchanged .</seg>
<seg id=1132>it is very significant that development is the thematic topic for this dialogue meeting .</seg>
<seg id=1133>development is the basis for the progress of human civilization and the key to solving various conflicts and problems the world faces .</seg>
<seg id=1134>only by ensuring a coordinated , balanced and universal development of the world can we achieve long - lasting global peace and stability .</seg>
<seg id=1135>we should conduct a comprehensive and in - depth discussion of this issue and make concerted efforts to find its solution .</seg>
<seg id=1136>the accelerating economic globalization has become the most prominent feature of the current world economy .</seg>
<seg id=1137>pushed by the trend of economic globalization , the relations among countries and regions have become increasingly close and the markets are getting more open . there has been an expanded and accelerated flow of capital , technology and personnel . all these have brought unprecedented opportunities for strengthening international cooperation and promoting common development .</seg>
<seg id=1138>at the same time , the trend of economic globalization has also posed harsh challenges and broadened the gap between south and north . some developing countries are faced with the danger of further marginalization . the increased economic and financial risks and the aggravating transnational crimes have also added to the urgency for international cooperation in jointly meeting the challenges .</seg>
<seg id=1139>at this juncture where opportunities and challenges coexist , we should seize the opportunities and meet the challenges . we should seek common grounds while reserving differences . and we should expand cooperation and push the economic globalization in the direction of common development and prosperity .</seg>

<seg id=1546>xinhua news agency , geneva , january 26 ( reporter li jie ) wto announced on the 26th that the petitions of the eu and other seven wto members to impose sanctions on the united states for its implementation of " byrd subsidy " have been submitted to the arbitration agency .</seg>
<seg id=1547>the petitions for sanctions originated from the united states ' failure to repeal " the byrd amendment " within the deadline set by wto .</seg>
<seg id=1548>" the byrd amendment " passed by the u.s. congress in 2000 requires the u.s. government to subsidize the victimized u.s. companies directly with the punitive tariffs collected in the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases instead of sending them to the u.s. department of the treasury .</seg>
<seg id=1549>the u.s. move was opposed by its major trade partners including the eu and japan .</seg>
<seg id=1550>wto finally ruled in january 2003 that the amendment violated the rules of the world trade and required the united states to repeal it by december 27 of the same year .</seg>
<seg id=1551>but the united states did not implement the wto ruling .</seg>
<seg id=1552>as a result , the eu , japan , canada , brazil , india , south korea , mexico and chile recently submitted petitions to the wto , requesting the permission to impose additional duties on some products originating in the united states in amounts equivalent to those of the u.s. government subsidies .</seg>
<seg id=1553>however , the united states immediately challenged the extent of the sanctions and the validity of the petitions .</seg>
<seg id=1554>( hong kong , maucao , taiwan ) retail sales in hong kong up 10% during spring festival</seg>
<seg id=1555>xinhua news agency , hong kong , january 28 hong kong retail management association disclosed that retail sales in hong kong are doing pretty well during the lunar new year . the industry has seen an average of 10% increase of business revenue while some shopping centers have even enjoyed 20% to 30% increases .</seg>
<seg id=1556>yu pengchun , chairman of the hong kong retail management association , indicated the other day that mainland tourists taking personal trips to hong kong have helped in creating a shopping atmosphere in hong kong . the retail sales during the spring festival are doing very well in hong kong . some sectors of the industry such as those of jewelry and apparel even enjoyed 20% to 30% increases of sales , with the spending of mainland tourists making up about 10% of the total business revenue .</seg>
<seg id=1557>he said mainland tourists , using rmb credit cards in hong kong , have obviously stimulated the market in the spring festival . each charge averaged 3,000 yuan . some mainland tourists even spent as much as over 10,000 yuan .</seg>
<seg id=1558>last year , the total retail revenue in hong kong dropped 4% due to sars .</seg>
<seg id=1559>yu pengchun predicts that with the economic recovery , the total retail sales in hong kong will have a single - digit increase , but the price of merchandise will be under pressure for upward adjustment due to the cost increase .</seg>
<seg id=1560>he said he believes the deflation in hong kong will be eased this year .</seg>
<seg id=1561>( international ) denmark releases new act that limits immigration</seg>
<seg id=1562>xinhua news agency , stockholm , january 28 , from copenhagen : the danish government submitted to the congress a new act that will limit immigration on the 28th .</seg>
<seg id=1563>under the act , children born in denmark to foreign immigrants will no longer have the privilege of obtaining the danish nationality automatically .</seg>
<seg id=1564>the act is the latest of a series of measures to limit immigration since the danish freedom party leader rasmussen took office as prime minister in november 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=1565>it is reported that the act is likely to be passed at the parliament because freedom party has gained the support of the right - wing danish people 's party over the immigration issue .</seg>
<seg id=1566>the act requires that instead of obtaining the nationality automatically , foreign children born in denmark apply for citizenship when they become adults just as other immigrants do .</seg>
<seg id=1567>naturalized immigrants will be deprived of their citizenship if they have committed criminal activities that are seriously detrimental to the society .</seg>
<seg id=1568>in the past two years , the danish government has released a series of measures to limit immigration , including setting limits on issuing long - term residence cards and on immigrants ' sponsorship of their relatives to come to denmark .</seg>
<seg id=1569>due to the danish government 's unfriendly attitude toward immigrants , the number of foreign refugees in denmark dropped from 14,347 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=1570>as a result , the traditional image of denmark as a country boasting freedom and human rights has also been tarnished .</seg>
<seg id=1571>in less than a month after the spring festival , three extraordinary serious accidents occurred in china , each killing dozens of people .</seg>
<seg id=1572>it is regrettable that there should be such a high frequency of accidents and heavy loss of human lives .</seg>
<seg id=1573>a few months prior to this , a natural gas blowout at a drilling well in chongqing , gas explosions at several coal mines and frequent serious road accidents had resulted in hundreds of deaths .</seg>
<seg id=1574>due to a vast area and dense population , china has a higher probability of disasters than any other countries and the resulting death toll can easily reach tens or even hundreds . objectively , this is a helpless reality .</seg>
<seg id=1575>however , judging from common sense , fatal accidents in china are still far too frequent .</seg>
<seg id=1576>among so many disasters , fire , explosions in coal mines , blasts in fireworks factories , and traffic accidents are the most common .</seg>
<seg id=1577>this at least shows two problems . first , the safety measures in these fields are the weakest ; second , people do not learn lessons from the past tragedies so that accidents of the same type keep happening .</seg>
<seg id=1578>in the past when singapore was in a period of rapid economic growth , there were also serious fire accidents . however , the tragedies , still vivid in memory , quickly raised singapore 's awareness of safety precautions in public places .</seg>
<seg id=1579>likewise , china today is also in an extraordinary stage of rapid economic growth and social restructuring .</seg>
<seg id=1580>from time to time , there is news that foreign maids working in this country accidentally fall from buildings . although the figure is not absurdly high percentage - wise , given the relatively safe working environment at home , the frequent occurrence of accidental falls from buildings by no means matches the virtually harmless nature of the job .</seg>
<seg id=1581>according to the statistics , a total of 99 maids of various nationalities died in accidental falls from buildings from january 1999 to june 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=1582>behind these figures we see not only the broken families that waited in vain for the return of their daughters or mothers and the misfortunes that should have been avoided , but also the direction of our work to reduce these regrettable figures to the lowest possible level .</seg>
<seg id=1583>according to a statement recently published by the indonesian embassy , 96 indonesian maids have died while working in singapore since 1999 . some of them fell to their death from tall buildings during work .</seg>
<seg id=1584>the indonesian government expresses its complaints from time to time about the accidental falls of maids and also set forth new regulations several times so as to rigorously control the qualification of indonesian maids in our country and ensure their safety . however , the problem persists . as a result , the bilateral relations between singapore and indonesia are inevitably troubled by this maid problem .</seg>
<seg id=1585>what invariably puzzles us deeply is that compared with the number of casualties of guest workers at the construction sites , the number of accidental falls of maids is surprisingly higher . this could not but make people think there is more need to further investigate its background and causes .</seg>
<seg id=1586>chen kongli , a world renowned expert on taiwan in the mainland , recently published his new book entitled " observing taiwan . "</seg>
<seg id=1587>most of articles collected in the book were all written in a period from the first rotation of political parties in taiwan 's government in march 2000 to chen shui - bian 's assertion of " one country on each side of the strait .  they are the author 's observations and reflections of the internal situation in taiwan and the cross - strait relations during the time when he " listened to what one said and watched what one did . "</seg>
<seg id=1588>since it took two years for these articles written two years ago to be published , it is obvious that the mainland has a very convoluted and time - consuming reviewing system for research papers on taiwan . this shows the publication of " observing taiwan " has gone through an uphill struggle .</seg>
<seg id=1589>since a long time ago , chen kongli has been taking an objective and truth - finding approach in his observation and study of taiwan . he did not restrict himself to any subjective and preconceived political framework and endeavored to explore unique and truthful insights .</seg>
<seg id=1590>the reading of this book gives one an even deeper impression of this special characteristic .</seg>
<seg id=1591>since the early 1980s , the study on taiwan has become the " popular study " in mainland china . various research institutes emerged one after another and all kinds of scholars and experts made their appearances and showed their talent .</seg>
<seg id=1592>overseas , people generally divide the research institutes on taiwan in the mainland into the northern school and the southern school .</seg>
<seg id=1593>the northern school takes a relatively official stance with strong rhetoric . it more often assumes an overbearing hawkish tone in some particular historic stages or in major political developments .</seg>
<seg id=1594>on the other hand , research institutes on taiwan of the southern school are generally located in areas south of the yangtze river , including shanghai and fujian .</seg>
<seg id=1595>japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi 's " academic records " of " studying in london for two years " were exposed by the japanese media as an exaggeration .</seg>
<seg id=1596>the japanese newspaper " the weekly post " verified with the office of registrar at london university and found that during his nine - month stay in britain , koizumi only audited a few classes as a part - time student at the university and did not earn any academic degree .</seg>
<seg id=1597>the chinese domestic media , big and small , vied with one another in reporting or reprinting this scandal to the great gratification of the general public .</seg>
<seg id=1598>indeed , it is shocking that a prime minister of a country , imposing as he is , should fake his academic records to cheat his own countrymen .</seg>
<seg id=1599>it is all the more shameful that this should happen in the " imperialist " japan .</seg>
<seg id=1600>however , if we view it from another perspective , we may find something positive in this scandal .</seg>
<seg id=1601>moreover , these positive things are exactly what we lack and they also show the area where we urgently need to make improvements .</seg>
<seg id=1602>in recent years , we have been advocating " honesty and trust , " " building a sunshine government , " respecting people 's " right to information " and enhancing the " transparency " of the administration . however , the reality is far from our ideal .</seg>
<seg id=1603>come to think of it . the falsification of a diploma by a countrys prime minister , while not a big deal by itself , can be exposed by the media and relentlessly pursued .</seg>
<seg id=1604>in such a country , what else cannot be brought under the sunshine ?</seg>
<seg id=1605>in taiwans evening campaign rallies , major camps usually shuttle their people to the site in tourist buses . however ,</seg>
<seg id=1606>not long ago , when taiwan 's president chen shui - bian shouted " let 's win the election ! " at a campaign rally somewhere in the north of the island , more than half of the audience did not give him the due respect of shouting with him because most of the local people have some relatives or friends who have gone to invest in the mainland and the long overdue " three direct links " and the non-performing financial policy have many of them concerned .</seg>
<seg id=1607>if nothing unexpected happens , we can assume from opinion polls , underground wagers and other signs at this countdown time to taiwans presidential election that chen - lu team will lose the election .</seg>
<seg id=1608>unless more sensational developments come up , such as a major pan-blue split - up or an even more embarrassing scandal , chen shui - bian , who fought such a hard battle of winning the power from lee teng - hui , will have proved that he has failed to effectively win the popularity in the past four years and that instead he has allowed the green camp to stage a continuous variety show of corruption and low taste before the public , which has consequently weakened the confidence of his supporters .</seg>
<seg id=1609>how is beijing going to deal with the pan-blue forces that may regain the power ?</seg>
<seg id=1610>first of all , we should understand that the pan-blue camp that may possibly regain the power is no longer the single big dominant party of the kmt but a combination of the blue and the orange and that there is the issue whether the internal tradition and the native faction can merge .</seg>
<seg id=1611>the current close cooperation during the election period cannot be regarded as necessary future relations .</seg>
<seg id=1612>if there are hopes of winning the election , internal restructuring will surely take considerable amount of time . the ensuing election of the legislative yuan at the end of the year will also make it very hard for the lien - soong administration to make any major changes in the cross - strait relations ,</seg>
<seg id=1613>unless it realizes that the improvement of the cross - strait relations can score points for taiwans internal politics and is also confident of producing a positive result within a short period of time which , most importantly , can be felt by the general public .</seg>
<seg id=1614>given this background , beijing should temporarily hold its efforts to push for the reunification and allow lien and soong , the two leaders of the " traditional blue camp , " some time to consolidate the internal situation .</seg>
<seg id=1615>more than half a century has passed since the united states conducted its first nuclear explosion in new mexico in july 1945 and dropped two atomic bombs in japan in august of the same year .</seg>
<seg id=1616>although the arms race between the two superpowers of the united states and the soviet union led to a stockpile of nuclear weapons sufficient for the destruction of the entire world , fortunately both parties realized the danger of a nuclear war and refrained from pushing the nuclear button .</seg>
<seg id=1617>after the soviet union was dissolved and the world entered the post - cold - war era , the danger of a large - scale nuclear war basically disappeared .</seg>
<seg id=1618>but meanwhile , the danger of nuclear proliferation increased rather than diminished .</seg>
<seg id=1619>the proliferation shows itself in two aspects .</seg>
<seg id=1620>in one case , some above - average countries with relatively rich resources and strength , out of their desire for regional supremacy , confrontation with their neighboring countries , safeguarding security or implementing blackmail diplomacy , are trying very hard to manufacture and possess nuclear weapons by all means .</seg>
<seg id=1621>in the other case , some non-state groups , especially the islamic extremists who harbor an intense hatred for the west , are also seeking small - size nuclear weapons by all means to carry out bloody terrorist attacks on the west with no regard to innocent civilians .</seg>
<seg id=1622>in response to this demand , there have emerged middlemen who engage in the transfer and sales of nuclear weapons and the related technologies , and " nuclear black markets . " moreover , their business is increasingly expanding in scope and has become an important part of the nuclear proliferation in the present world .</seg>
<seg id=1623>as a chinese who grew up in the hangjiahu region , images of rural areas and the peasant life in the old central east china still stay in my memory .</seg>
<seg id=1624>returning to my hometown after many years , i found the lush green farmland along shanghai - hangzhou expressway is strewn with three - storied houses built by peasants themselves , but i seldom saw anyone working in the fields .</seg>
<seg id=1625>this came as a real surprise to me . it is hard to believe that such tremendous changes have taken place for those people and lands that i have never stopped missing while living abroad .</seg>
<seg id=1626>however , i was greatly surprised and shocked by some reportage and scholars ' field surveys on the conditions of rural china that i read recently on the internet .</seg>
<seg id=1627>i never knew that such an unimaginable dark side still exists in rural china and that the chinese peasants are still living such a hard life in humiliation and without rights .</seg>
<seg id=1628>in " chinese peasants : a survey , " a long reportage published by chen guidi and his wife after the couple conducted a field survey in the rural areas of three provinces of anhui , henan and hebei , they voiced grievances on behalf of peasants and stirred up the chinese society .</seg>
<seg id=1629>based on a large number of facts that peasants were oppressed , exploited and even murdered for no apparent reasons by corrupted officials , they came to this conclusion : " when we came into closer contact with the chinese peasants , we felt such a shock and anguish that we had never felt before . the poverty , evils , helplessness , resistance , silence and sadness we witnessed were all beyond ones imagination . "</seg>
<seg id=1630>these are truly heart - wrenching words .</seg>
<seg id=1631>just as anticipated , malaysian prime minister abdullah announced the dissolution of the parliament the day before yesterday and the general election for the new parliament will be held in the coming days .</seg>
<seg id=1632>to abdullah , this election will be an event of great significance in his political career . to the political situation in malaysia and its trend of development , the outcome of this election is also of landmark significance .</seg>
<seg id=1633>only four months have passed now since abdullah took over from mahathir last november .</seg>
<seg id=1634>in spite of this , he still decided to dissolve the parliament and hold the election ahead of schedule .</seg>
<seg id=1635>this at least has two implications : first , abdullah is satisfied with his job performance for the past four months and is confident about the intent of voters . second , he hopes to consolidate the foundation of his power by this means so as to emerge from the shadow of mahathir .</seg>
<seg id=1636>doubtlessly , abdullah 's decision to hold a blitz election shows that he has already made a comprehensive assessment of the political situation in the country .</seg>
<seg id=1637>the current economy in malaysia is performing well and there is no issue that the opposition party can make a big case of or capitalize to their advantages .</seg>
<seg id=1638>besides , since abdullah took office , he has taken some measures with relatively high publicity to fight corruption , such as arresting and prosecuting the former land and cooperative development minister kasitah gaddam on charges of graft . they not only earned him some favorable acclaims but also made the public optimistic about the future anti-corruption operations .</seg>
<seg id=1639>in the meantime , he urged to improve the efficiency of civil services , which is another action to boost peoples morale .</seg>
<seg id=1640>since its establishment , the development and shaping of the european union have been strongly influenced by the french politics and culture .</seg>
<seg id=1641>seeking diplomatic independence and autonomy , the eu wants to be distinguished from the united states in its attitude and approach to handling international affairs . this guides the eu diplomatic policy and obviously reflects the subtle influence of france .</seg>
<seg id=1642>it is exactly for this reason that the international community , including china , russia and arab countries , all hope to see the rise of the eu as a completely independent force in international exchanges .</seg>
<seg id=1643>it must be admitted that since the late 1980s , the eu has indeed been working toward this goal in its diplomacy .</seg>
<seg id=1644>in december 1992 , all heads of state of the eu agreed unanimously at the maastricht summit that all member states would implement a common foreign policy so that they would speak in unison to the outside world .</seg>
<seg id=1645>however , the so - called " common foreign and security policy of the eu " met its first fiasco two years later in handling the issue of bosnia .</seg>
<seg id=1646>from the maastricht summit up till now , the eus 10 - year diplomacy has achieved very little .</seg>
<seg id=1647>what is even worse is that the eus foreign policy utterly failed to withstand the test of major events .</seg>
<seg id=1648>the various positions the member states took on the u.s. war on iraq not only proved this but also revealed once again the eu 's fatal political flaw . that is , it can be easily divided and ruled by other big powers and then won over one after another .</seg>
<seg id=1649>on february 24 , president bush announced at the white house that he would support the constitutional amendment that bans same - sex marriage .</seg>
<seg id=1650>this is a clear shift from the equivocal attitude toward this issue he has adopted for months and represents an important development in politics during the u.s. presidential election year .</seg>
<seg id=1651>the constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage is a very powerful political weapon in the newly emerged republican headquarters in the american south , but it also has an enormous negative effect . since it is a heavyweight cultural dispute that divides public opinions nationwide , it doubtlessly will aggravate the political polarization in the united states and further distance the liberal - dominated east and west coasts .</seg>
<seg id=1652>for bush himself , who repeatedly claimed to be " a uniter " not " a divider " during the 2000 election , this is obviously a broken promise .</seg>
<seg id=1653>moreover , as the young generation in the united states has become more and more liberal toward the homosexuality issue , this act of bush , though effective in the short term , will do damages to the long - term interest of the republican party .</seg>
<seg id=1654>bush 's new offensive of " constitutional amendment " can be described as his " scotched earth strategy " for this year 's presidential election .</seg>
<seg id=1655>bush resorted to this ploy because he is losing his ground on the two major issues of anti-terrorist war and economy / employment and has to open up a new battlefield in religious and cultural issues that divide public opinions in the nation .</seg>
<seg id=1656>the u.s. attitude so far remains cautious .</seg>
<seg id=1657>in other words , since maintaining the status quo in the taiwan strait can meet the long - term goal of the united states to strategically balance the power of the chinese mainland , the united states will avoid any political and military conflicts with china resulting from encouraging taiwan 's independence .</seg>
<seg id=1658>understandably , it is not likely that the united states will completely eliminate the space for taiwan to hold a referendum exactly as beijing requested , but it will also take some pre-warning measures out of considerations for its own interest .</seg>
<seg id=1659>recently , u.s. secretary of state powell , out of his own initiative , reiterated the existing policy on taiwan and stated the u.s. opposition to taiwan 's independence .</seg>
<seg id=1660>this demonstration of position is interpreted by the public as aiming at deterring and preventing chen shui - bian from going to the extreme .</seg>
<seg id=1661>the recent remarks made by some u.s. think tank personnel with government connections and the u.s. deployment of a large number of spy ships to the taiwan strait in the coming days to spy on the military activities of both sides of the strait are indirect evidence that the united states is very much concerned with the situation in the taiwan strait .</seg>
<seg id=1662>it shows from another perspective that although the united stats will not completely prevent taiwan from holding the referendum as beijing requested , it is equally concerned with the uncertainty of the situation in the taiwan strait during this period .</seg>
<seg id=1663>any large - scale and one - on - one election eventually will have only one result . either chen shui - bian is lucky enough to get reelected by a narrow margin , or lien chan reclaims the taiwan presidential office .</seg>
<seg id=1664>what makes one worried is that due to unequal access to information , people from all sectors of society in the chinese mainland seem to have not psychologically prepared for the possibility that chen shui - bian may still win the election .</seg>
<seg id=1665>in the event that the outcome of the election is not what has been expected , beijing will again find itself in an unnecessary passive situation .</seg>
<seg id=1666>an ancient arab saying goes : " one day 's turmoil is more horrible than a thousand years of tyranny . "</seg>
<seg id=1667>is this what the northeast asian countries are currently worried about ?</seg>
<seg id=1668>i think the answer is probably affirmative .</seg>
<seg id=1669>a famous research and development center close to washington d . c . and funded by the u.s. government examined in a recent study the four policy options to deal with north korea 's nuclear crisis . they are engagement , containment and deterrence , economic sanctions , and preemptive strikes .</seg>
<seg id=1670>the attitude of the countries in the region toward these tactics is the focus of this survey .</seg>
<seg id=1671>in addition , the survey also analyzes the threats posed by north korea 's nuclear weapons program based on the possibility of nuclear attacks and the potential damage they can cause as perceived by the peoples of north korea 's neighboring countries and their sense of fear .</seg>
<seg id=1672>both china and russia consider the danger of north korea 's use of nuclear weapons low or very low , while japan and south korea regard it as a significant threat .</seg>
<seg id=1673>all northeast asian countries agree that they should keep engaging north korea .</seg>
<seg id=1674>japan , on the other hand , supports containment and deterrence . other countries also consider the strategy of containment and deterrence acceptable under certain circumstances .</seg>
<seg id=1675>singapore cares very much about its international rankings and pays year - long attention to country rankings in various areas released by the european and u.s. agencies .</seg>
<seg id=1676>constantly being at the top of lists naturally adds to our interest in keeping track of rankings .</seg>
<seg id=1677>however , being no . 1 in every area has its own share of trouble .</seg>
<seg id=1678>in the opinion of most of our countrymen , you appear worried about being a loser if you pay too much attention to rankings , yet you look arrogant if you show off your rankings .</seg>
<seg id=1679>therefore , people advise us that we should live a more elegant and carefree life and had better stand aloof from the worldly success .</seg>
<seg id=1680>as many people in the past would not deign to pay any attention to the rankings , there appeared a funny phenomenon that people no longer seemed to regard being " no . 1 in the world " as good news but rather tended to treat it as something embarrassing .</seg>
<seg id=1681>however , things have changed back in the past year or two .</seg>
<seg id=1682>we feel unsure of the long - term competitiveness of our country , and people in all walks of life also worry about their job security .</seg>
<seg id=1683>with this uncertainty , we no longer talk in an elegant and carefree manner as we used to .</seg>
<seg id=1684>in the intense global competition , being too elegant and carefree can give others a chance to catch up and surpass you and you may easily fall behind from your top rankings in every area .</seg>
<seg id=1685>on the outside , bush appears to be pretty loyal to cheney . at the meeting of republican governors at the end of last month , bush still promised solemnly that he would choose none other than cheney for his running mate .</seg>
<seg id=1686>however , he also said half jokingly that just as in 2000 , he has placed cheney in charge of finding a candidate for vice president .</seg>
<seg id=1687>cheney , who always hides his talents and keeps a low profile , has made frequent public appearances lately in interviews with the media , denying that he will be replaced .</seg>
<seg id=1688>but he still left some room for himself .</seg>
<seg id=1689>he said he would not hesitate to bow out should he have health problems or feel himself a real burden on the president .</seg>
<seg id=1690>cheney , 63 , has a history of four heart attacks .</seg>
<seg id=1691>recently it is widely rumored that the u.s. military has actually encircled osama , the mastermind behind the sept .11 attacks , and is only waiting for the right time to arrest him .</seg>
<seg id=1692>as the voting for the presidential election is on november 2 , it is said that the pentagon has already arranged for the good show of capturing osama alive to be put on in october .</seg>
<seg id=1693>however , a long delay may give rise to hitches . should osama slip through the net , there may be no end of trouble for the future .</seg>
<seg id=1694>it seems that giuliani , after all , is pretty much the trump card that bush may count on for winning the votes .</seg>
<seg id=1695>the competitors for the 2004 u.s. presidential election have been confirmed : the democratic candidate kerry challenging the incumbent republican president bush .</seg>
<seg id=1696>they have started " warming up " activities such as campaign advertisements and election debates prior to the november election .</seg>
<seg id=1697>their confrontation either orally or in written form may center on the three major topics of war , economy and social issues .</seg>
<seg id=1698>bush believes that the war is closely linked with the national security of the united states . either sending troops to topple saddam or fight against terror , it is all for the sake of ensuring the security of the united states . therefore , he tells his countrymen time and again : " we are at war . "</seg>
<seg id=1699>kerry , of course , will point out that it is wrong for bush to abuse the erroneous intelligence that iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction to launch the war on iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1700>speaking of economy , kerry thinks bush 's tax relief plan helps the rich and fails to create new jobs .</seg>
<seg id=1701>bush shows kerry : are n't the u.s. economic figures going up ?</seg>
<seg id=1702>as for the social issues such as the relationship between man and woman , bush opposes same - sex marriage and abortion , and supports death penalty , whereas , kerry is also aganist same - sex marriage but supports abortion and opposes death penalty .</seg>
<seg id=1703>how bush and kerry present their own viewpoints on these three major issues to the voters and convince them via ads , television and speeches will be all the political shows the two are going to put on for the next eight months .</seg>
<seg id=1704>however , on the diplomatic issues , kerry has more room to show off his acting skills .</seg>
<seg id=1705>according to statistics , young people who choose to commit suicide are mostly teenagers 15 to 19 years of age , but it is also not uncommon for children as young as 10 to 14 years old .</seg>
<seg id=1706>academic pressure is generally believed to be the cause of child and teenage suicide . however , studies find that emotional problems , especially those pertaining to sexual love and parental relationship , are actually the main reasons that local young people commit suicide .</seg>
<seg id=1707>academic pressure and disappointment resulting from failed expectation also certainly pertain to the category of communication between parents and children .</seg>
<seg id=1708>the pressure of getting into a higher school is an inevitable burden on local school children during their growing up . sometimes the pressure is self-induced , while more often the pressure is imposed on children by their parents .</seg>
<seg id=1709>parents demand children have good academic performance and compare their own children with other children at every chance . although the demand of academic excellence puts quite a lot of pressure on children , the mediation and communication behind the pressure are the true indicators of the relationship between parents and children .</seg>
<seg id=1710>if parents beat and scold their children or show blame on their faces when children 's performance is less than perfect , or even make children feel they are disappointments , they will doubtlessly push their children to helplessness and desperation .</seg>
<seg id=1711>it is known that many young students who need counseling became mentally disturbed after they were pushed into desperation by their parents ' over - expectations .</seg>
<seg id=1712>the success and rapid development of singapore make parents feel their children are much better provided for than they themselves were and therefore they naturally expect their children to perform better than they themselves did .</seg>
<seg id=1713>more often than not , parents forget that they actually might not be particularly outstanding in all fields when they themselves were children .</seg>
<seg id=1714>at the age of one year and a half , most children are sent to boarding nurseries set up by various agencies or work units for a nominal fee . children come home only once a week or even once a month .</seg>
<seg id=1715>today , singapore is facing the social issues of a declining birth rate and an aging population .</seg>
<seg id=1716>the young generation is too busy with keeping their modern life style and fashionable material comforts to respond to the government 's call for early marriage and childbearing .</seg>
<seg id=1717>i have a bold proposal to make : the government should take care of infants .</seg>
<seg id=1718>the people need only to be concerned about childbirth not childcare .</seg>
<seg id=1719>on the one hand , the government will sponsor setting up boarding nurseries and kindergartens and change elementary schools to full day care even with three meals provided , all for a nominal fee that citizens can afford .</seg>
<seg id=1720>this will not only create jobs for the unemployed , but also relieve the government from worrying whether such measures as infant bonuses , extended maternity leave , quality of maids , and tax rebates will work or not .</seg>
<seg id=1721>what beijing needs to do is not only acting as the chief leader of the six - nation talks but also developing strategic deployment as soon as possible to take precautions in the long - term interest of china in the korean peninsula .</seg>
<seg id=1722>specifically , beijing should urge north korea to abandon its nuclear weapons on the one hand , and start with reforming the kim jong il regime and lead it toward modern civilization on the other so that it can eliminate the danger of a nuclear war in northeast asia and keep the status quo in the korean peninsula , gaining more clout for long - term strategic negotiations with the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1723>in spite of its fierce facade , pyongyang is actually weak inside and longs for economic development and integration into the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1724>only this longing is often demonstrated by an outward appearance of aggressiveness , irrationality and complete lack of conformity with international rules .</seg>
<seg id=1725>in fact , beijing has been using its influence and economic aid measures for some time to force pyongyang to change its position that is not in conformity with international rules .</seg>
<seg id=1726>but this action still needs planning in all aspects .</seg>
<seg id=1727>beijing 's aid to pyongyang should not be limited to the economic field but rather be expanded to other social fields . the objective should not be limited to forcing pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program but rather should lead it toward modern civilization .</seg>
<seg id=1728>when kerry first entered the arena , nobody thought he would have too much of a chance . at the time , all the spotlight was on dean , the former governor of vermont .</seg>
<seg id=1729>however , kerry emerged like a dark horse in january prior to the iowa caucuses and took the victory at the caucuses and primaries in the two most crucial states of iowa and new hampshire .</seg>
<seg id=1730>in the following primaries of other states , kerry basically never lost except in the home states of other participating candidates .</seg>
<seg id=1731>within only six weeks , kerry became the front - runner from a candidate with almost no hope . all his rivals , including gephardt , lieberman , clark , dean and edwards dropped out of race one after another , making people take a fresh look at kerry for his political charisma .</seg>
<seg id=1732>in his 19 years of career as a senator , kerry has always supported abortion and environmental protection policies and opposed tax relief plans that benefit the rich . he is dedicated to raising the minimum wage and finding a solution to global warming .</seg>
<seg id=1733>his working experience in washington shows his willingness to confront social challenges and his courage in defying authorities and pursuing values with no fear of displeasing the interest of the minority .</seg>
<seg id=1734>china 's policy of reform and opening up started with agriculture . rural residents were the earliest beneficiaries of this policy .</seg>
<seg id=1735>however , in the late 1990s , the agricultural reform basically came to a standstill due to the dramatic shift in economic policy toward towns and cities , and the gap between urban and rural areas was further widened .</seg>
<seg id=1736>as time passes , two entirely different worlds have emerged in china , one is the highly prosperous urban china , and the other is the impoverished rural china .</seg>
<seg id=1737>to use a chinese official jargon , the widening gap between urban and rural areas in china is " an issue of development , " and must therefore be solved through continued development .</seg>
<seg id=1738>in other words , the development of the coastal areas and urban areas in china should continue without being hindered by the problems in rural areas .</seg>
<seg id=1739>however , seeing some metropolitan cities undergoing small changes in a year and big changes in three years , people could not but ask why some impoverished areas have seen no changes in the past decades ?</seg>
<seg id=1740>of course , we should recognize the fact that urban and rural areas have very different ways of development . but the question is when large amount of funds are invested in urban construction and encouragement and support are given to the wealthy middle class , have rural residents , who make up 70% of the entire population , also been given the attention and emphasis ?</seg>
<seg id=1741>in theory , the chinese governments , both past and present , have undeniably paid due attention to the issues of agriculture , rural areas and peasants .</seg>
<seg id=1742>however , as the conditions in rural areas have been more and more deteriorating in recent years , the emphasis given is obviously less and less adequate .</seg>
<seg id=1743>in any country , police , prosecutors and courts should not only be symbols of justice and fairness but also form the most important system of safeguarding social stability .</seg>
<seg id=1744>but unfortunately , they have become symbols of corruption in china .</seg>
<seg id=1745>according to the latest report from the national auditing department , the audition of the financial expenditures in the public security agencies in 26 provinces and cities last year shows that the public security agencies in the country had illegally collected a total of 16.5 billion yuan in fines and penalties .</seg>
<seg id=1746>the crisis of trust in police , prosecutors and courts has now come out into the open .</seg>
<seg id=1747>the cases of liu yong and sun zhigang and the recent " bmw " incident all reflect this profound crisis of trust .</seg>
<seg id=1748>the " bmw " incident is even more typical .</seg>
<seg id=1749>people are far more concerned with this issue than their concern with sars during the sars period .</seg>
<seg id=1750>in fact , what people are concerned is not the " bmw " incident itself , but the fact they could no longer trust the entire judicial system .</seg>
<seg id=1751>being clearly aware of that , the relevant department soon put a tight lid on the media .</seg>
<seg id=1752>but , the problem is still there .</seg>
<seg id=1753>the second round of six - nation talks on north korean nuclear issue ended the way it was generally expected .</seg>
<seg id=1754>during the talks , all parties concerned got together and explored the peripheral issues of the peninsula nuclear crisis and reached consensus on holding the third round of talks before the end of june this year , setting up a working group and other matters .</seg>
<seg id=1755>however , the talks yielded no progress on those substantive issues like how north korea should scrap its nuclear weapons program and how the united states should afterwards ensure the political and military security in north korea and provide north korea energy aid . instead it gave the feeling that the " fast knot " only got more tightened with each attempt to pull it loose .</seg>
<seg id=1756>both of the two protagonists , the united states and north korea , showed no concession ; and each stayed firm with its basic position .</seg>
<seg id=1757>what draws attention , however , is the u.s. attitude at the talks that showed no urgency to solve the problems and gave the impression of " footdragging . "</seg>
<seg id=1758>this tactic that the united states showed is closely linked with the new developments of the current international situation and the interests it is seeking in these new developments .</seg>
<seg id=1759>the united states has never seen so many corporate ceos jailed since roosevelt became the president .</seg>
<seg id=1760>is the recent exposure of a string of crimes in quick succession a result of coincidences or the explosion of the public or investor 's pent - up fury over corporate crimes and other illegal activities in the past three years ?</seg>
<seg id=1761>there may not be a simple answer , but it is a fact that the criminal activities of many corporations are exposed recently .</seg>
<seg id=1762>this bodes well for the recovery of economy and especially the restoration of investor confidence .</seg>
<seg id=1763>as the late 1990s might be the most chaotic and also the most elusive period in the history of the u.s. commerce , the sooner its impact vanishes , the better .</seg>
<seg id=1764>once the curtain falls , the names of some companies are bound to fade into history , eventually ending up only in textbooks of business schools .</seg>
<seg id=1765>whereas , other companies , such as tyco and mci , will work hard at reorganization to welcome the new round of economic growth under the leadership of new management teams .</seg>
<seg id=1766>when will the new round of economic growth come ?</seg>
<seg id=1767>as a ceo , you may not have the answer .</seg>
<seg id=1768>but this does n't matter , because federal reserve chairman greenspan does n't know the answer either .</seg>
<seg id=1769>the bush administration wants to adopt keynesianism to stimulate economy by greatly increasing expenditures ( in particular , national defense expenditures ) on the one hand , and drastically reducing taxes on the other .</seg>
<seg id=1770>internationally , the bush administration continues to promote free trade while its trade deficit has hit a new high of 549 billion u.s. dollars .</seg>
<seg id=1771>however , the substantial tax - cuts failed to bring about any significant growth in investment and consumer spending .</seg>
<seg id=1772>according to the new keynesians represented by the famous british economist godley , the u.s. economy has been in such a mire that bush 's financial strategy will not be able to salvage it .</seg>
<seg id=1773>they think that the so - called " law of markets " is only an illusion that inevitably leads to profits for the minority and losses for the majority .</seg>
<seg id=1774>people used to think that in the entire world the so - called profit - making minority are all in the united states , while the loss - taking majority are all in developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=1775>now , things turn out to be otherwise .</seg>
<seg id=1776>many in the u.s. economics community think that in addition to the u.s. - based multinationals , india and china have also become prominent current winners of globalization .</seg>
<seg id=1777>india has taken over the service economy , while china dominates in the manufacturing sector .</seg>
<seg id=1778>while people focus their concern on the mass transfer of the u.s. capital and manufacturing equipment to china , they fail to see the advantage of china 's labor market which is characterized by high skills and low costs .</seg>
<seg id=1779>first , whether the current situation in taiwan is within or beyond beijing 's assessment .</seg>
<seg id=1780>how beijing made its assessment is known only to beijing itself , but the result of the assessment can be inferred by outsiders from what can be openly observed .</seg>
<seg id=1781>for four years , the pro-independence camp headed by chen shui - bian and annette lu has demonstrated its position in clear terms and efficient operation and actively proceeded with taiwan 's independence .</seg>
<seg id=1782>in contrast , beijing adopted a nearly routine tone occasionally punctuated by high pitch sounds and appeared indifferent to the progress of taiwan 's independence .</seg>
<seg id=1783>however , it has taken a sharp turn since last fall . the magnitude of change is evident in the past few months as its capacity of handling took a wide departure from what it used to be in the 1990s .</seg>
<seg id=1784>judging from this , it can be assumed that the current situation in taiwan is within its assessment .</seg>
<seg id=1785>second , take a look at the diplomacy with taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=1786>the developments of the situation in the taiwan strait depend on whether major countries like the united states adopt a pro-beijing or pro-taipei attitude .</seg>
<seg id=1787>since all countries are open about their attitudes , the answer is very clear .</seg>
<seg id=1788>as of today , all countries have not only been getting closer to beijing with more concrete exchanges and growing more distant away from taipei with less substantial exchanges , they have also started to give " mild but significant " advice to taiwan 's democracy that has until now enjoyed praises .</seg>

<seg id=1>after the world entered the new century , african countries were confronted by an important and serious challenge because of economic globalization .</seg>
<seg id=2>leaders of african countries have come to realize more and more clearly that africa cannot afford to let slip the excellent opportunity and should start immediately to find policies and measures to deal with it .</seg>
<seg id=3>on july 9th , 2002 the african union was formally set up and began to work . from then on african countries , on the one hand , began to actively implement " the new partnership for africa 's development " , worked hard to develop economy and strive to get rid of the unfavorable plight in economic globalization as soon as possible . on the other hand they made special efforts to settle the issues of armed conflicts - a main obstacle to the renaissance cause of africa so as to create a united , peaceful and stable environment .</seg>
<seg id=4>the general situation in africa at present is relaxing and the hot spot issues are cooling down . the countries are more and more eager to put an end to the armed conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=5>backed up by un and the international community , the influential regional organization in africa , the regional powers and famous statesmen have taken positive actions and stepped up their efforts in settling regional conflicts and removing internal turmoil . some conflicts and turmoil which lasted for years have been basically brought under control .</seg>
<seg id=6>for instance a national unity government was set up in congo ( kinshasa ) in june last year ; in july sao tome and principe solved the coup d ' etat crisis with peaceful means ; in august the libyan government signed a peace accord with the anti-government armed forces in the ghana capital of accra ; in september the sudanese government began a key talk with the anti-government forces in the south , which broke the deadlock of the peace process ; in october the various armed and political factions in somalia began their peace talk in kenya and talked about the nationwide peace process ; in november the burundi government signed a peace accord with the anti-government troops ; etc.</seg>
<seg id=7>of course the stability in africa at present is still fragile and the fruits of peace need to be consolidated . some potential and existing armed conflicts are to be finally settled .</seg>
<seg id=8>at the same time there is still a great gap between african countries and developing countries in asia and other continents in terms of the speed of economic development . these are the unfavorable elements for african development .</seg>
<seg id=9>how to deal with the challenges of economic globalization effectively in african countries and realize the african dream of renaissance , the african people have to make long - term and arduous endeavor .</seg>

<seg id=53>the nuclear expert of the delegation is hecker who led the american los alamos national laboratory , the very laboratory which the atom bomb was first developed , from 1985-1997 .</seg>
<seg id=54>before this north korea notified the american embassy in beijing that the pyongyang authorities are ready to attend the delayed second round of 6 - party talks on the nuclear crisis on the korean peninsula .</seg>
<seg id=55>an american official points out this week that the pyongyang authorities have made it clear that it will attend the 6 - party talks to be held early this year .</seg>

<seg id=57>the second round of the 6 - party talks was originally scheduled to be held last december . it had to be postponed until early this year due to differences over what measures to take to solve the problems .</seg>
<seg id=58>the washington authorities want north korea to give up its nuclear program unilaterally . however , the pyongyang regime insists that the usa provide security guarantee that has legal binding power in return for its waiver of nuclear program .</seg>

<seg id=472>heavy snow in northwest europe caused communication and transport chaos</seg>
<seg id=473>( afp in paris on 29th ) heavy snow swept over western and northern europe , causing communication and transport chaos . it forced britain , germany and denmark to cancel hundreds of flights .</seg>

<seg id=478>in france traffic control is imposed in paris after the snowfall last night , but similar measures in other french areas have been removed this morning .</seg>
<seg id=479>it is reported that all services in the major airports of paris have almost returned to the normal . the snow and fog caused many flights to postpone in the d ' gaulle airport yesterday .</seg>
<seg id=480>however , paris airport authorities advise air passengers to make sure whether their flights are puncture before leaving home .</seg>
<seg id=481>most of france is covered with snow except the mediterranean areas .</seg>
<seg id=482>taiwan and japan are both democratic nations , which have obligation and responsibilty to work together for consolidation of democracy in asia .</seg>
<seg id=483>in order to advocate the value of democracy the government of our country will soon set up " taiwan foundation for democracy " which will regard international cooperation of political parties as one of its priorities on its agenda .</seg>
<seg id=484>the democratic progressive party wishes to work hand in hand with democratic parties of other countries by this means and share its development experience in democratic progress with other countries , make contribution to peace , stability and prosperity of asia and realize the ideal of " asian democratic league " as early as possible .</seg>
<seg id=485>today when the international situation changes instantly fast , the fluctuation of regional powers causes changes in the entire world and the security of every nation is on trial .</seg>
<seg id=486>as far as the asian and pacific region is concerned , north korea who is arrogant to have nuclear facilities has trial - launched missiles many times since us started its war against iraq last month . the missiles flew over japanese territorial sky . besides , china has accelerated its arms expansion and aimed its missiles at taiwan since long time ago .</seg>
<seg id=487>all of this has posed a great menace to the security of taiwan , japan and the whole asian - pacific region .</seg>
<seg id=488>such issues as related to consolidating democracy and maintaining security can only be discussed and solved through a formal security mechanism .</seg>
<seg id=489>today 's conference is the first formal dialogue on security between the democratic progressive party in power in taiwan and the liberal democratic party in power in japan and parliament members of other political parties . its importance is obvious .</seg>
<seg id=490>i myself hope that , in addition to the bilateral dialogue between taiwan and japan , the peripheral countries of asian - pacific region like us , japan and south korea will work together to promote the establishment of " a security dialogue mechanism " , to support taiwan in participating in the multi-lateral dialogues and to implement the spirit of " cooperative security " .</seg>
<seg id=491>today it is an important moment which encourages us to continue our march on the road of reform . we give our highest regard to all the comrades in the party who embody our party spirit and endeavor to achieve the goal of reform together .</seg>
<seg id=492>" political parties withdrawing from the radio and tv media " is the most fundamental requirement of medium reform and also the idea which the democratic progressive party has always adhered to . the democratic progressive party in power will accelerate the pace of reform instead of being a hindrance or a burden .</seg>
<seg id=493>we are also aware that to achieve this goal the party members of public service should take the lead to leave media . although this is a small step in the reform , it is also a key step .</seg>
<seg id=494>in the past age of martial law and medium monopoly , many of the party comrades , in order to strive for an open space for public opinion , have shouldered the difficult mission to set up the 4th tv station and local broadcasting stations . they wished to break through the existent limitation and add vigor to promote the reform of medium environment by this means .</seg>
<seg id=495>for example , comrade trong chai took painstaking efforts for the birth of the 4th tv station and " formosa television " was born at last .</seg>
<seg id=496>this success had considerable impact on the whole medium environment . it broke up the monopoly by 3 stations and created larger space for the progress of catv .</seg>
<seg id=497>but we must know that there are many deeds we have to do in the process of reform due to limits of historical environment . therefore , today 's complete open and free medium space represents the achievement of some periodic tasks . to continue the reform process , we have to give up things and make sacrifice .</seg>
<seg id=498>the standing members of the party central committee demand that all the party members of public service withdraw from tv medium business before the next session of the legislative opens . i.e. before september 5 so as to set an example and honor their promise to the people .</seg>
<seg id=499>we greatly appreciate all your efforts to adhere to party 's ideals and goals , including trong chai , chang chun - hsiung , chou ching - yu , hou shui - sheng , kao meng - ting , hwang nai - hui and shen ming - gong who gave up their personal interests to promote the medium reform .</seg>
<seg id=500>to be a ruling party does not mean the holding of power but the increase of responsibilities .</seg>
<seg id=501>the democratic progressive party has suffered setbacks and bumps in the process of holding power , but we can always turn challenges into motives for advance and lead taiwan in constructing the project of deepening its democracy . at the same time we try to meet international standards in global democracy , peace and prosperity .</seg>
<seg id=502>for we are always convinced that only the people are the masters of the country and the responsibility of the democratic progressive party is to upgrade the party 's founding spirit of " clean , diligence and love for the homeland " to the prospects of " reform , progress and a good life " so as to lay a foundation for the long - term peace for the 23 million people in taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=503>for a long time the democratic progressive party has played the role of " part of the government " in the effort to expand the diplomacy of taiwan and has made outstanding achievements in this regard .</seg>
<seg id=504>we have never yielded to the continual pressure from the communist party of china because we have destiny in our own hands . even if there are no rich resources , the democratic progressive party has made headways step by step and has created room for taiwan to participate in international affairs .</seg>
<seg id=505>" multi-diplomacy " has been the chief axis of the overall diplomatic strategy of the democratic progressive party . in the past year we have , based on the platform of " asian federation of liberal democracy " , carried out successful experience sharing and party exchange with the countries in the region on such issues as east asia 's economic challenges , democratic reform of political parties , sweeping away money politics , global poverty , political publicity and communication , youth participation in politics .</seg>
<seg id=506>i will take over the chairman of " cald " in march of next year and wish to create more opportunities for taiwan to contribute more to the international community in the capacity of a world organization leader .</seg>
<seg id=507>besides , the democratic progressive party took an active part in the affairs of " liberal international " after it became its member last year .</seg>
<seg id=508>apart from sending its representative to the london head office of the federation , the democratic progressive party will cooperate with other member parties and hold forums in central and southern america and europe on political reform .</seg>
<seg id=509>on september 28 , this party of ours spent its 17th birthday .</seg>
<seg id=510>the democratic progressive party , 17 years of age , has upheld its ideal of democracy since its birth and is now filled with the power of reform and progress .</seg>
<seg id=511>it is because we have been on the side of democracy and reform that we have won the trust of the taiwan people . it is because of this that the responsibilities and missions we bear for the future become even more grave and great .</seg>
<seg id=512>three years ago we took over the load of ruling the country . the past ruling parties in the 1990s had the constitution revised 6 times with a tortuous way .</seg>
<seg id=513>in 1991 overall re-election of the parliament was held ; in 1994 the president was directly elected ; in 1997 the provincial government organizations were frozen ; in 2000 the national assembly became non permanent . the series of constitution revisions are the legality trail of taiwan people in intensifying sovereignty and democracy .</seg>
<seg id=514>if we regard the direct election of the president in 1996 as the most significant sign to show that taiwan has become a democracy with independent sovereignty , this country " in its integrity " is already over 10 years old .</seg>
<seg id=515>after 10 years of practice we should ponder what to pursue next as a democracy with independent sovereignty .</seg>
<seg id=516>we must say that at the next stage we should further pursue more profound democracy and more efficient constitutional government system . only by doing this can we lead the taiwan people in confronting severe challenges of the new century .</seg>
<seg id=517>asia is the largest continent in the world . its area is nearly 30% of the earth 's land surface and now its population accounts for about 60% of the whole world . its total economic volume takes up one fourth of the world 's total . it should and is well capable of making outstanding contributions to the world 's peace and development .</seg>
<seg id=518>asia has long and brilliant cultures . the drainage areas of the yellow river and the yangtze , the indus and the ganges valleys , and the reaches of the euphrates and the tigris are famous birthplaces of human civilizations .</seg>
<seg id=519>in the long process of historical development the asian peoples have written splendid chapters for the development of human civilization .</seg>
<seg id=520>in modern times asian has experienced hardships and sufferings . people of various country have made unremitting efforts for liberation and development and have gained tremendous achievements .</seg>
<seg id=521>but there is still a long way to go if asia wishes to have a new rise and to enjoy new prosperity .</seg>
<seg id=522>to strengthen cooperation , promote development and achieve win - for - all is a way asia must follow in order to rise and become prosperous . it is also where the fundamental interest of the asian people lies .</seg>
<seg id=523>in the new situation of the new century asian development faces new opportunities .</seg>
<seg id=524>peace and development are the themes of the contemporary world and the overall peaceful international environment provides favorable external conditions for asian development .</seg>
<seg id=525>the deepening economic globalization , the giant strides of the world technological revolution , the optimizing regrouping of international production factors and the accelerated industry transfer are favorable for asian countries to utilize international capital , introduce advanced technologies , expand the world market and promote the economic development of their own countries .</seg>
<seg id=526>asian , with rich resources and vast markets , is an area in the world with the greatest economic vitality and with tremendous potentials for development .</seg>
<seg id=527>great population and under - development are the two state conditions of china .</seg>
<seg id=528>with 1,300 million people in china , any problem , no matter how insignificant it may be , will become a big one if multiplied by 1,300 million . any financial or material power , no matter how tremendous it may seem to be , will become a very very low level if divided by 1,300 million .</seg>
<seg id=529>this is what the chinese leaders must bear in mind at all times</seg>
<seg id=530>to solve the problems of the 1,300 million people , we can depend on none other than ourselves .</seg>
<seg id=531>since the people 's republic of china was founded , we have achieved a lot in our construction . but we have taken a roundabout course and lost some opportunities .</seg>
<seg id=532>since we initiated reform and opening - up in 1978 , we have finally found at last a right path for our own development .</seg>
<seg id=533>in other words , the chinese people should build socialism with chinese characteristics in an independent way .</seg>
<seg id=534>the essence of this path is to mobilize all positive factors , liberate and development productive forces and respect and guarantee the freedom of the chinese people to pursue happiness .</seg>
<seg id=535>the reform and opening - up in china spread from the rural areas to the cities , from the economic realm to the fields of politics , culture and society .</seg>
<seg id=536>in the final analysis , each step further aims at giving free play to all energy and initiatives of labor , knowledge , technology , management and capital and letting all sources of creating social wealth to flow completely .</seg>
<seg id=537>profound changes have taken place in the world in recent years . science and technology have developed by leaps and bound ; the world production level has kept rising ; links of the world market are increasingly closer . all this offers historic opportunities for the development of all countries .</seg>
<seg id=538>however , what is noteworthy is the fact that power politics , regional conflicts , terrorism , epidemic diseases , the worsening of environment , etc. pose great threat to the world stability and development .</seg>
<seg id=539>the negative influence of economic globalization add to the risks and costs for the economic and social development of developing countries . some developing countries even face the danger of being out of mainstream .</seg>
<seg id=540>presently the world economy still faces a lot of uncertain factors although it is steadily being recovered .</seg>
<seg id=541>the doha round of multi-lateral trade talks suffered a setback . trade protectionism and other complicated factors increase the difficulties for developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=542>what is gratifying is that the developing countries have taken a positive enterprising spirit , been bent on reform , hard - working stance and have made remarkable achievement .</seg>
<seg id=543>on the international arena developing countries , based on non-aligned movement and group of 77 , have strengthened their unity and cooperation and made important contributions for safeguarding their own legal interests and changing the irrational orders of the world politics and economy . they have become important forces for the promotion of democracy in international relations .</seg>
<seg id=544>in the meanwhile significant progress has been made in the exchange and cooperation between developing countries . the economic exchange between them has become more frequent .</seg>
<seg id=545>from the andes to the mekong , from the union de maghreb to the establishment of african federation , the south - south co-operation has kept enriching , improving and updating itself in both content and form , mechanism and means .</seg>
<seg id=546>the past year is a year of sustained overall development of friendship and cooperation between china and canada .</seg>
<seg id=547>the trade between the two nations is on the rise with the total trade approaching 10 billion usd .</seg>
<seg id=548>top leaders visit frequently each other . canadian ministers of foreign affairs , national defense , environment and international cooperation have visited china . president of china 's supreme court and chinese minister of commerce have visited canada . what is more important is that the premiers of the 2 countries have visited each other .</seg>
<seg id=549>premier wen jiabao 's visit to canada not long ago was of significance in carrying on the past and opening up for the future . it added new vigor to the further development of the bilateral relations laid a solid foundation for developing the friendship and cooperation in great breadth and depth .</seg>
<seg id=550>china and canada will continue to intensify their cooperation in such fields as politics , economy , culture , education , science and technology and will strive to double their bilateral trade volume by 2010 .</seg>
<seg id=551>dear compatriots and dear friends ,</seg>
<seg id=552>although you reside overseas , you are concerned with your homeland , with its construction and development . at every critical moment you share weal and woe with the people of your motherland and your pulse beats simultaneously with that of the motherland .</seg>
<seg id=553>last year when some regions in china were hit by sars and flood , you expressed your deep concern and blessings for the people of the homeland through web , correspondence , telephone and contributions . overseas chinese from all circles sponsored series of donation activities and charity performances . after " the shenzhou 5 " manned space ship was successfully launched , your congratulation calls , letters and cards poured in and everyone felt encouraged and proud of china 's success in space flight technology .</seg>
<seg id=554>during premier wen jiabao 's visit to canada , hundreds of chinese residents and students went to the airport and the parliament hill to greet the premier in bitter cold . there were many touching scenes .</seg>
<seg id=555>i would like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my thanks to everyone . i believe you will do more contribution for china 's prosperity , for promotion of china - canadian relationship , for china 's reunification and overall rejuvenation .</seg>
<seg id=556>first , to promote mutual political trust and deepen the strategic cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=557>china and france , the permanent members of the security council of un , are both influential to international affairs .</seg>
<seg id=558>both of our two countries are for the promotion of world pluralism and for safeguarding the un authority , willing to help set up a new political and economic order in conformity with the interest of the people of all countries .</seg>
<seg id=559>our two countries share an extensive consensus and common interest in dealing with various challenges confronting mankind and in handling major international affairs .</seg>
<seg id=560>we are ready to strengthen our dialogue and consultation with france on such important issues as fighting against terrorism , preventing nuclear proliferation , cracking down on transnational crimes , promoting common development and intensifying the role of un . we will forge close cooperation and be committed to safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .</seg>
<seg id=561>secondly , to step up economic and trade cooperation so as to achieve mutual benefit and mutual complementation .</seg>
<seg id=562>china , the largest developing country in the world , is devoted to its modernization drive . it offers extensive and vast markets .</seg>
<seg id=563>france , a developed country , ranks on the top in the economic and technological level in the world . it leads the world in technology in many fields .</seg>
<seg id=564>the two countries are highly mutual complementary in economy and have great potentials for economic and trade collaboration .</seg>
<seg id=565>since new china was established in 1949 , chinese government has attached great importance to developing relations with africa and has worked out a series of policies .</seg>
<seg id=566>we have always abided by the 5 principles of peaceful coexistence and respected the right of african countries to independently choose their political systems and path of development . we have supplied as much aid as we can to african countries and carried out economic and technological cooperation . we have supported african countries in their unity and cooperation to become strong , urged the international community to pay enough attention to peace and development in africa and backed african countries to equally participate in international affairs . we have intensified consultation and cooperation between china and africa so as to jointly defend the interests of developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=567>sino - african friendship has had a long history and has stricken roots in the hearts of the people .</seg>
<seg id=568>ever since new china was established in 1949 , we have always supported the national liberation cause in africa and sincerely aided african countries to develop their national economies .</seg>
<seg id=569>chinese experts , doctors , teachers and workers sent to africa have worked shoulder to shoulder with the local people and their friendship is as profound as that between brothers .</seg>
<seg id=570>on international affairs china and african countries have understood each other and supported each other . we have become trusted partners .</seg>
<seg id=571>the chinese people will never forget that it was with the powerful support of developing countries including african countries that china successfully restored its legitimate un seat at the 26th general assembly of un in 1971 .</seg>
<seg id=572>in recent years mutual political trust has been deepened between people at different levels and from different fields in china and africa ; economic and trade cooperation has been fruitful ; friendly exchange in the fields of culture , education , public health , science and technology and sports has progressed vigorously . the sino - african cooperation forum set up early in the century has formed a new platform for the development of sino - african relation and deepening of cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=573>china and africa are resolved to forge a long , stable and new partnership of equality and mutual benefits . the sino - african friendly cooperation has entered a new stage of overall development .</seg>
<seg id=574>7 years after nixon visited china and the sino - america shanghai communique was published , carter administration accepted china 's stand on taiwan and effected the diplomatic relations between china and us .</seg>
<seg id=575>this incident and the successful visit to us by deng xiaoping opened a new chapter in the annals of relations between china and us .</seg>
<seg id=576>when reagon was in power , fierce disputes occurred on taiwan issue .</seg>
<seg id=577>hard talks between the governments of the two countries resulted in the well - known " august 17 " communique in 1982 , with an agreement reached on partial settlement of arms sale to taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=578>shanghai communique , the communique on establishing diplomatic relations between china and us and the " august 17 " communique jointly formed the political cornerstone for sino - american relations .</seg>
<seg id=579>during the 10 years after the diplomatic relations were established , the sino - american relations on the whole were stable with the exchange and cooperation in various fields , despite occasional strifes over the taiwan issue and other problems .</seg>
<seg id=580>in the 1980s and early 1990s , the most profound changes took place in the world situation since the second world war : drastic changes in east europe , the disintegration of the soviet union and the end of the cold war .</seg>
<seg id=581>us took the lead in imposing sanctions against china , announced to sell 150 f - 16 fighter planes to taiwan , linked human rights issue to the most - favored - nation treatment and permitted lee teng - hui to visit america . all this reduced sino - american relations to a record low .</seg>
<seg id=582>as china 's economy developed fast , its international position kept rising .</seg>
<seg id=583>more and more americans came to understand that the improvement and development of sino - american relations were beneficial to both countries .</seg>
<seg id=584>half a year ago and in this very hall , we successfully started the process of 6 - party talks and set the orientation for peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue .</seg>
<seg id=585>for half a year , the parties have carried out uninterrupted dialogues and discussions and made lots of profound preparations for the new round of talks . through the process we have promoted the understanding of each other 's stand .</seg>
<seg id=586>now all the parties expect to talk about substantial problems and acquire the concrete achievements in the second round , are agreed on settling problems of common concern by concerted procedures and hope to continue the peace process started by the 6 - party talks .</seg>
<seg id=587>these form the important basis of our talks today .</seg>
<seg id=588>the importance of the second round of talks lies in starting to discuss substantial issues . this indicates a new step forward in the peace talk process .</seg>
<seg id=589>this round involves how to determine the concrete goals of settling nuclear problem , discusses the measures for the first stage of the settlement and studies the way of keeping the talk process going .</seg>
<seg id=590>with the talk going in depth , we shall have to deal with more difficulties and greet more challenges , but this is the responsibility that history affords us and it is also the expectation of the international community .</seg>
<seg id=591>we 6 parties gather here , representing the strong political wish of the governments and peoples of the 6 countries .</seg>
<seg id=592>our talk aims to expand our consensus , not to give prominence to our differences . our aim is to solve problems , not to intensify contradictions .</seg>
<seg id=593>the chinese party believes that all the parties are aware of their peace missions , will adopt constructive attitudes , show the spirit of cooperation and understanding , respect each other , display flexibility and narrow down the differences .</seg>
<seg id=594>the second round of 6 - party talks in beijing has completed its scheduled agenda after 3 days of discussion .</seg>
<seg id=595>i extend my thanks to the contribution made by the governments , delegation heads , delegates and the staff .</seg>
<seg id=596>if we say the first round of talks determined the general goal of achieving nuclear - weapon - free on the peninsula , the significance of this round lies in carrying out substantial dialogues , a new step towards the realization of the general goal .</seg>
<seg id=597>during the talks , all the parties conducted deep and constructive discussions , explored the ways and procedures of settling the problem with wisdom and sense , proposed valuable plans and made positive announcements of policies .</seg>
<seg id=598>this talk has achieved a series of instructive results , especially a consensus has been reached on the next round and on setting up a working group . this is of great significance for pushing forward the talk process .</seg>
<seg id=599>dear colleagues , peace and development are the theme of this great age of ours .</seg>
<seg id=600>peoples of the 6 nations represented by the delegates present need peace , long for peace and love peace . peoples of the world need peace , long for peace and love peace .</seg>
<seg id=601>in the 3 days the international community has focused its attention on beijing and on diaoyutai . it cherishes great hopes on this round of talks .</seg>
<seg id=602>some people may think that the results of the talks are not many enough and the process is not fast enough .</seg>
<seg id=603>my view is that this round of talks was started when the relevant parties were lack of trust each other and the difference between positions of the parties was widened .</seg>
<seg id=604>the chinese government has been consistent in its stand on taiwan issue , i.e. the basic policy of " peaceful reunification ; one country and two systems " .</seg>
<seg id=605>for this purpose we have made every endeavor , have shown the greatest sincerity and have lots of work .</seg>
<seg id=606>however , our efforts met with provocation from taiwan authorities and forces that advocate " taiwan independence " .</seg>
<seg id=607>we respect the demand of taiwan people for democracy , but we oppose the " taiwan independence " activities launched by taiwan authorities and " taiwan independence " advocates in the name of democracy in order to separate taiwan from its motherland .</seg>
<seg id=608>the reason why we clearly demonstrate our determination and will to maintain the unity of our motherland is to maintain peace and stability in taiwan region .</seg>
<seg id=609>we have already made it clear that , so long as there is the slightest hope , we will do our best to reunify china by peaceful means .</seg>
<seg id=610>we appreciate president bush 's reiteration of his stand of one china , which sent a clear signal to the forces that advocate " taiwan independence " .</seg>
<seg id=611>leaders of taiwan authorities claim : " to prevent armed invasion of taiwan by china and one - sided change of the status quo across the strait , we advocate 3.20 public referendum . "</seg>
<seg id=612>this is a slander of the peace efforts by the mainland and a provocation to the relations across the strait .</seg>
<seg id=613>at present the actual threat to taiwan security does not come from mainland but from the " taiwan independence " spitting activities launched on a large scale by the taiwan authorities .</seg>
<seg id=614>it is the splittism forces of " taiwan independence " that sabotage the status quo of the relations across the strait and are the immediate sources of menace against peace in taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=615>the taiwan authorities distorted the position of the mainland to oppose " taiwan independence " splittism and maintain taiwan stability as a suppression of democracy and liberty of taiwan . with this pretext , it plans to launch a public referendum .</seg>
<seg id=616>this is sheer fabrication and confounding black with white . its real aim is to win sympathy and support for its splittism line .</seg>
<seg id=617>the leader of taiwan authorities advocates the so - called " defensive public referendum " and " peaceful public referendum " , which , in whatever package they may be , will only give rise to opposition and hostility across the strait , further aggravate the tension and push the relations across the strait gradually onto the edge of danger .</seg>
<seg id=618>this runs counter to the mainstream public opinion of taiwan compatriots for peace , stability and development . it is misleading to and a control of taiwan public instead of a deepening of taiwan democracy . it is also a menace to the peace and stability of the asian - pacific region . it will undoubtedly meet with the general opposition of the compatriots across the strait and the international community .</seg>
<seg id=619>making a general survey of the historical process of the development of the chinese nation and you will find that unity has always been the mainstream , the general irresistible trend and the will of the people .</seg>
<seg id=620>with growing increasingly stronger in china and the cooperation across the strait being continuously promoted , the international community commonly acknowledges that one - china frame is more stable and any attempt to split china is bound to fail .</seg>
<seg id=621>it is more than 2 weeks away from the lunar new year , one of the traditional festivals most popular with the chinese people .</seg>
<seg id=622>on this joyous and happy day we are accustomed to getting together with our relatives and friends and exchanging gifts to express good wishes .</seg>
<seg id=623>the hong kong post service , with the intention of " transmitting good will and offering business opportunities " and with the cooperation of china post , has unfolded this " china - hong kong gift delivery service " which helps hong kong citizens to give their good wishes and blessings to relatives , friends and clients either in the mainland or in hong kong during the spring festival .</seg>
<seg id=624>for a long time hong kong post service has cooperated with other postal authorities to provide special international delivery service .</seg>
<seg id=625>at early as in december 2002 it worked with the australian post to provide western wine logistics service so as to supply quality products for hong kong residents .</seg>
<seg id=626>this time the cooperation with china post has upgraded our close cooperation that has always existed between us in postal business , remittance , express delivery , etc. to the level of logistics service . to meet the growing needs of hong kong residents to send gifts to relatives , friends and clients in the mainland , we have introduced this " china - hong kong gift delivery service " .</seg>
<seg id=627>the first batch of gifts are new year gift boxes of various sizes and styles which contain the seasonally popular candies , tea leaves , sea foodstuffs , etc. with a great range of prices , there is enough room for choice .</seg>
<seg id=628>they are all very presentable presents good for both relatives and business partners on the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=629>for 30 years consumer council has made universally - recognized contribution in safeguarding the interest of consumers .</seg>
<seg id=630>the best way to evaluate the work results of consumer council is to judge whether or not substantial improvement of consumers rights and interest has been made .</seg>
<seg id=631>i agree to what chairman chen has just said very much . through 30 years of work , not only are customers clear about their rights and interest , but also all circles of the society pay attention to their interest . this is the result of the efforts made by consumer council and the government .</seg>
<seg id=632>consumer council conducts regular test of products and carries out market investigations and trade operation studies of various products and service . it also releases fair and objective market information through choice , a monthly journal .</seg>
<seg id=633>very popular with the residents , choice is having its web edition which will bring its function into effective play and help consumers acquire market information more conveniently and more quickly .</seg>
<seg id=634>consumer council has set up 11 regional consumer consultation centers and 16 phone hotlines to provide information about commodities and services and to accept the consumers ' complaints .</seg>
<seg id=635>since its inception , consumer council has received more and more callers from the several thousand annually in 1970s to 146,000 last year , more than 20 times increase . this shows that more and more consumers choose to consult the reports and suggestions of consumer council before they make decisions in choosing products and service .</seg>
<seg id=636>besides , the number of complaints which have been handled by consumer council this year exceeds 26,000 .</seg>
<seg id=637>consumer council also criticizes by name some stores and shops with malpractice , which not only helps consumers to avoid being cheated but also serves as a warning and intimidation to store keepers .</seg>
<seg id=638>mp yuang , i told you on july first that i was watching tv carefully . later i had reflections and saw that some residents have appeals and complaints and are resentful against the administrative practices of the government .</seg>
<seg id=639>in this aspect the government and i have been working hard to improve our work in the past six to seven months . seeing that the residents are demanding for improvement of economy and livelihood , i have also made lots of efforts in this regard . also knowing that the residents are complaining about article 23 of basic law , we withdrew article 23 . in fact the government responded promptly .</seg>
<seg id=640>as to the demand for democracy in society , i am also aware of it .</seg>
<seg id=641>but mp yuang , i wish to tell you that , what i am doing today is to ensure everything goes smoothly once constitutional review begins . so some fundamental problems must be solved first . they are two different things .</seg>
<seg id=642>what are the fundamental problems ?</seg>
<seg id=643>some are matters of principle and some are legal problems . as for some articles in basic law which involve institutional review , how should we understand them after all ? work in this aspect must be done first .</seg>
<seg id=644>we are right now doing this work . a group of three have started to do the job .</seg>
<seg id=645>it may go and consult the central government and may also stay in hong kong and listen to the public opinions . i think this is a very good step . we made the decision because we attach important to the opinions of the hong kong society .</seg>
<seg id=646>in today 's very competitive business environment , brand name plays an essential role for the success of products .</seg>
<seg id=647>a famous brand cannot be created overnight . it needs innovative design , good quality , thoughtful package , effective marketing and sustained investment .</seg>
<seg id=648>hong kong has conditions suitable for creation of famous brand name .</seg>
<seg id=649>we have relevant know - how , skills and experience . we have rich talent resources from design to manufacture , to marketing , to management . we also have vast markets .</seg>
<seg id=650>the cepa which has just begun to be implemented adds to our advantages . apart from zero tariffs to enter into the mainland market , its best advantage is to urge merchants to use their brains more often and strive to promote the added value of products so that their products become famous brands loved by consumers of hong kong , the mainland and even the whole world .</seg>
<seg id=651>" the hong kong 10 famous brand election " launched by chinese manufacturers association and the added - value development trend of hong kong products pushed by cepa happen to be a coincidence .</seg>
<seg id=652>for 5 years the election has given birth to 51 " hong kong 10 famous brand " .</seg>
<seg id=653>however , in such a vast market as the mainland , 51 famous brand are nothing . we need hundreds , thousands of , and even more and more " hong kong famous brand " .</seg>
<seg id=654>hong kong subway has participated in the subway projects of major cities in mainland . it brought its rich experience to the mainland market through service .</seg>
<seg id=655>i feel happy that hong kong 's investment , professional service and managers are recognized for their quality in the mainland market .</seg>
<seg id=656>such exchange between shenzhen and hong kong not only helps the developmet of the motherland but also affords more developing opportunities to hong kong businessmen . in addition to promoting economic development it also creates more job opportunities for hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=657>the conclusion of the agreement in principle for the project results really from the policy support of the central government and the government of shenzhen special economic zone . i feel grateful to them .</seg>
<seg id=658>the subway company invests for the first time outside hong kong . it participates by investment in the development of a mainland subway and introduces the hong kong brand name to the mainland . this is really something gratifying for both hong kong people and mainland compatriots .</seg>
<seg id=659>i hereby hope that shenzhen no . 4 subway line will soon be approved by the central government . i wish success to the project so that a solid foundation is laid for more exchange and cooperation between shenzhen and hong kong in the future .</seg>
<seg id=660>today is january 5th of the lunar new year . i am glad to be invited by the chinese gold & silver exchange society to participate in your new year celebration and preside over the opening ceremony of the new year gold market .</seg>
<seg id=661>first of all i would like to extend new year greetings to you . i wish you good luck , good fortune and every success in the year of monkey .</seg>
<seg id=662>the gold price rocketed last year and it surpassed 400 usd per ounce recently . the continuous rise reflects that the investors have again gained confidence in gold .</seg>
<seg id=663>i believe you have been busy in your business last year .</seg>
<seg id=664>in fact the brisk market , apart from the influence from outside factors , shows the achievements of the gold & silver trade market after over 90 years of endeavor .</seg>
<seg id=665>the endeavor not only has laid a good foundation stone for hong kong gold market but also has contributed a lot to consolidating hong kong 's status as an international finance center .</seg>
<seg id=666>there is a saying that goes : " the whole year 's work depends on a good start in spring . " i hope my colleagues in the gold & silver trade market will continue to work hard , seize the opportune time to promote the further development of the market and try to meet the needs of gold trade brought about by the reform of mainland gold market , china 's accession to wto and cepa .</seg>
<seg id=667>i am confident that , with the hard work of my colleagues , the hong kong gold market will surely score brilliant success in the coming year .</seg>
<seg id=668>lastly , i wish you lively transactions on gold market , prosperity in all trades and success in business in the year of monkey .</seg>
<seg id=669>thank you all .</seg>
<seg id=670>however , the past challenge was not confined to aiding public house property . private house property was also full of trial .</seg>
<seg id=671>financial storm broke out in 1997 and assets foam soon ruptured . as a result the price of real estate dropped by 70%, dealing a serious blow to house owners . this also served as the main cause for the worsening deflation in the past 5 years .</seg>
<seg id=672>now economy is taking a turn for the better . we are resolved to maintain a stable environment and ensure a sustainable and sound development of the real estate market .</seg>
<seg id=673>a sound real estate market is really essential for the further recovery of hong kong economy .</seg>
<seg id=674>we are also devoted to the protection and improvement of our living habitat .</seg>
<seg id=675>our future work will be based on the principle of sustainable development . we will adopt better city design , strengthen the protection of scenic spots and historical sites in hong kong and improve the living environment .</seg>
<seg id=676>we will pay even more attention to the issue of overall environment .</seg>
<seg id=677>the lesson of the sars outbreak in hong kong last year reminded us that we must exert ourselves to create a more spacious , cleaner and hygienically and healthy habitat .</seg>
<seg id=678>we will intensify our efforts to beautify our environment by planting more trees , building more parks and providing more entertaining and fitness facilities for our residents .</seg>
<seg id=679>i extend my thanks to many parliament members who have voiced their opinions on administration of justice , laws , constitution , public servants and the support of organizational staff and public security in the " government policy address " delivered by the chief executive .</seg>
<seg id=680>as for the category of judicial and legal service , only two parliament members margaret ng and tsang yok - sing made speeches . they are chairman and vice-chairman of the panel on administration of justice and legal services of the legislative council .</seg>
<seg id=681>the chief executive puts forward many measures in his " government policy address " to promote people - centered administration , including strengthening ties between chief officials and the society , conducting more researches in public policies , enhancing cooperation between the government and the legislative council , carrying out constitutional review seriously and carefully .</seg>
<seg id=682>the department of justice will participate in all of the above work to ensure that all the government measures conform with laws and procedures , especially with the basic law , including the basic rights and freedom of citizens it guarantees . at the same time , it will keep alert , as a parliament member , margaret ng mentioned , and safeguard the independence of legality and judicature in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=683>as a chief official , i will do my best to solicit ideas and criticisms from the public and people in the legal circles on judicial affairs and issues of legal profession .</seg>
<seg id=684>for an example , cepa results from close cooperation between the government and the legal circles such as bar association , law society , association of china appointed attesting officers .</seg>
<seg id=685>we have successfully included " legal service " into cepa . it has become one of the open service trades on the mainland . it serves as a new platform for the cooperation in legal service and will bring about macro - and long - term benefits for both sides .</seg>
<seg id=686>the work of the special responsibility group is two - way . we will inform the central government about our work in listening to the public opinions of hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=687>from mid - january to the present of this year we have interviewed more than 10 organizations and persons .</seg>
<seg id=688>all the interviewees accept the concept without reservation that the constitutional development of hong kong should conform to " one country two systems " and the hong kong special administration region is directly under the jurisdiction of the central government .</seg>
<seg id=689>the majority of them think that the political system of hong kong needs improvement . however , at the same time they also accept the idea that any development should be in conformity with the basic law .</seg>
<seg id=690>the organizations and persons have their own ideas about some specific procedures and legal issues .</seg>
<seg id=691>the special responsibility group will submit all their wishes , ideas and proposals wholly and entirely to the central government .</seg>
<seg id=692>in the forthcoming month the special responsibility group will continue to interview organizations and persons and to submit the ideas and opinions of the interviewees to the central government .</seg>
<seg id=693>this is the first meeting between the special responsibility group and the relevant departments of the central government . in the future we still need more contacts and communication with the central government .</seg>
<seg id=694>i believe everyone knows that the constitutional development is related to the relationship between the central government and the administration special region . the central government has constitutional right to examine the constitutional development of the administration special region . we need to have full consultation with the central government .</seg>
<seg id=695>west kowloon culture & entertainment district , an unprecedented large cultural and art program in hong kong , will not only provide room for residents to engage in cultural , art and entertainment activities but also help to promote the qualities of the residents and the metropolis .</seg>
<seg id=696>the construction of west kowloon cultural & entertainment district belongs to the whole hong kong society .</seg>
<seg id=697>the government must continue to study the project with all social circles so as to draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas .</seg>
<seg id=698>we understand that we cannot afford to pursue beauty and magnificence of the building only , it must be of economic benefits , be able to develop in a sustained way and help promote the quality of the residents ' livelihood .</seg>
<seg id=699>therefore , the government attaches special attention to the software complements of west kowloon cultural & entertainment district . there must be corresponding measures , including the managing policies of the facilities , the publicity strategy of the cultural and art programs , the contents of the performances and exhibitions , the publicity strategy , etc.</seg>
<seg id=700>ideas of " users " should be carefully listened to before these strategies are worked out .</seg>
<seg id=701>the younger generation , including every youngster present here , will be one of the users of west kowloon cultural & entertainment district .</seg>
<seg id=702>we hope that the district will be good for people of all ages and for both refined and popular tastes . it should be appealing for both hong kong residents and the tourists from outside , for both the matured generation and the vigorous youth .</seg>
<seg id=703>i know you had discussions this morning on different categories of west kowloon cultural & entertainment district . some of the students have made painstaking efforts and prepared special reports . i believe you are very familiar with the detailed data of the project .</seg>
<seg id=704>i am eager to hear the results of your discussions and to have a chance to exchange ideas with you .</seg>
<seg id=705>since the september 11 terrorist attack the world attention is focused on the security of ports , airports and borders .</seg>
<seg id=706>as the first largest port that sends the greatest number of containers to the usa , hong kong undoubtedly made prompt response to the " container security initiative " raised by us .</seg>
<seg id=707>besides , we believe to cut off the lifeline of terrorist organizations is an effective way to check terrorist activities .</seg>
<seg id=708>large sums of money circulating in the global financial system every day has been perplexing for law - enforcing agencies aiming at benefits of crimes and cleaning up dirty money .</seg>
<seg id=709>as the important financial center in asia , we believe to cut off money supply for terrorists may be the most effective way to deal a deadly blow to their structure .</seg>
<seg id=710>presently , the hong kong legislation is considering proposals for improvement so as make present laws and regulations more effective in cracking down on activities of providing financial aid to terrorists . at the same time it gives active cooperation with international standards and situation , e.g. new proposal for setting up a special department to annihilate cleaning up dirty money , amending laws , etc.</seg>
<seg id=711>besides , we are preparing perfect data release legal cases so as to facilitate related agencies and personnel in reporting suspected transactions .</seg>
<seg id=712>" balance " is the key to the work in this regard . effective investigation power , constitution - protected freedom and privacy and the efficiency of economic and financial systems are all the factors that must be taken into account .</seg>
<seg id=713>our control measures are based on legality , degree of openness , fairness and efficiency .</seg>
<seg id=714>as a matter fact hong kong 's service trade enjoys advantages in many aspects .</seg>
<seg id=715>professional and commercial service talents in hong kong have profound knowledge about the international commercial operation and the commercial operation on the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=716>hong kong 's services in accounting , finance , law and arbitration are best partners of mainland enterprises which are being internationalized and are trying to adapt themselves to international standards and conventions .</seg>
<seg id=717>and our transport , architecture , design , publicity of market affairs , management counseling , information technology , conference , exhibition and other services are conducive to promoting the overall competitive and productive powers of mainland enterprises and help the enterprises and their products to work out marketing strategies and to promote their brand name images .</seg>
<seg id=718>for tourism , medical care , insurance and other services are even more helpful in promoting the development of related markets and trades on the mainland and in raising their service level .</seg>
<seg id=719>the close cooperation in service trades between the two places will greatly help increase their respective advantages and jointly face various opportunities and challenges brought about by economic globalization .</seg>
<seg id=720>to promote the development of our professional services on the mainland , secretary of the department of finance and i , together with officials from the policy bureau and the execution commission and representatives from different trades , held substantial and valuable discussions in beijing last week with our counterpart departments and institutions on the mainland on mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other issues of common concern .</seg>
<seg id=721>i am happy to see the conclusion of agreements of qualification mutual recognition and cooperation in the 3 professional services of architecture , structure engineering and insurance . this is an important step for hong kong services to seek development on the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=722>through this conference the professional organization of hong kong has forged closer ties with the control and management agencies of mainland , laying a positive foundation for the next stage of the friendly cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=723>i am confident that the overwhelming majority of hong kong residents love their motherland and hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=724>the links and relations between mainland and hong kong in economy , society , politics and culture have always been close and closely bound up either before or after hong kong 's return to china .</seg>
<seg id=725>in terms of economy we see that hong kong industry has had chance to shift northwards and has had new room for development since china began to launch its four modernization , reform and opening up over twenty years ago . this has drawn closer the relationship between mainland and the hong kong society .</seg>
<seg id=726>recently we have further chance to make arrangements for closer trade links with the central government so that various service trades in hong kong will have new opportunities to participate in the mainland economic development in a more active and more extensive manner and do more things for our motherland and for hong kong . this will draw closer the relationship between hong kong and mainland .</seg>
<seg id=727>in terms of social progress we have seen in recent years that the country is advancing with gigantic strides .</seg>
<seg id=728>hong kong residents leapt with joy when seeing the successful bid of beijing to host 2008 olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=729>a few months ago , mr. yang liwei visited hong kong and hong kong people also leapt with joy . why ?</seg>
<seg id=730>because we feel that our country has scored such a success enough to make everyone , every hong kong residents to feel proud .</seg>
<seg id=731>i know the legislative council began to discuss with the government about the issue of long - term office of the legislature as early as 10 years ago .</seg>
<seg id=732>in the meanwhile the government has been always considering a long - term plan for the relocation of the government headquarters after the past 10 years .</seg>
<seg id=733>therefore i understand that the government decision to postponed the relocation project including the timar development project of the new office building of the legislative council will surely disappoint some of legislative council members .</seg>
<seg id=734>i know the legislative council members will have to suffer from many inconveniences and work in places of poor condition during this period .</seg>
<seg id=735>however , just as i told my government colleagues who are affected by the decision , i hope that everyone will put the interest of the public in the first place , get to know the situation and put up with it in this period .</seg>
<seg id=736>some time ago i explained several times to the administrative committee of the legislative council that the government thought it was not the right time to carry out the timar project or the project of a large office building , after giving consideration to the present financial situation and the financial status after the outbreak of sars .</seg>
<seg id=737>to put off the project of a new legislative building located at timar will help reduce the financial pressure on the government for the next couple of years , is in conformity with the public interest and is accepted by the public .</seg>
<seg id=738>the government will , as soon as the financial situation improves , start the new legislative building project located at timar . we will do this according to our present plan .</seg>
<seg id=739>the state cares for hong kong very much and the president and the premier show great concern for hong kong . i believe they and the central government will do their utmost to do good job in this regard .</seg>
<seg id=740>therefore , good tidings will keep coming in such service trades as tourism , finance , coordination of infrastructure construction , traffic rights , product zero tariffs , etc.</seg>
<seg id=741>i also do hope that hong kong will contribute more to the development of the country by making more and better use of its advantages , as hong kong economy recovers .</seg>
<seg id=742>when i met with premier wen jiabao , i congratulated him , on behalf of hong kong , on the gratifying achievements scored by the state under his leadership in the past difficult year . although the future is filled with challenges , he is fully confident as everyone of you has heard in his work report . we feel deeply encouraged by this .</seg>
<seg id=743>premier wen also told me that , by refreshing our minds with the important statement of " one country two systems " made by mr. deng xianping 20 years ago , we will have an overall and accurate understanding of the principle of " one country two systems " and we will find it very significant and very conducive to the future development of the constitution .</seg>
<seg id=744>he also told me that hong kong people should seize the opportunity and concentrate on economic development and the people 's livelihood . he has full confidence in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=745>not long afterwards i met with mr. zhang dejiang , party secretary of guangdong province , and mr. huang huahua , governor of guangdong province and had discussions with them on how to promote our cooperation from the present basis to a higher level and how to create a larger win - win situation .</seg>
<seg id=746>the last point is " hong kong people administering hong kong " which has become very familiar with all of us recently . the system requires that hong kong be administered by hong kong people whose main body consists of patriots .</seg>
<seg id=747>patriots are judged by clear criteria . they must respect their own nation , sincerely support the state to resume its sovereignty over hong kong and never do anything harmful to the state and hong kong . such people are patriots and constitute the main body of hong kong people that administer hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=748>i have to reiterate that hong kong people as a whole are patriotic .</seg>
<seg id=749>here i do not refer to the ordinary hong kong residents , but to those people who participate in the administration of public affairs in hong kong , that is , those high - level personnel in administrative structure , in the legislature and the judiciary organs .</seg>
<seg id=750>when taking an oath of office , they should declare their support of the basic law of hong kong special administrative region in accordance with the basic law and swear to be loyal to hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china .</seg>
<seg id=751>the 5 to 6 principles and important considerations mentioned above were actually recognized as long - term policies in 1980s when the long - term future of hong kong was being discussed and the " joint declaration " and the basic law were being drawn out . they have remained unchanged and will never change , for they are the long - term policies since the state resumed its sovereignty over hong kong and they are basic policies of the state which will never change .</seg>
<seg id=752>since the birth of intellectual property system several hundred years ago , especially since the industrial revolution , important epoch - making inventions have come into being one after another .</seg>
<seg id=753>in the past 20 years the intellectual property system has been an important legal system and a significant policy means in promoting technological innovations and has played a pivotal role in enlivening economy and enhancing international competitive power .</seg>
<seg id=754>at present with the development of scince and technology and economic globalization by leaps and bounds , creation , possession and utilization of knowledge and intellectual resources , quantities and quality of the possessed intellectual property have become important basis for a country to participate in international competition .</seg>
<seg id=755>therefore , to intensify the international exchange and cooperation in the protection of intellectual property is of great significance for establishing a just and reasonable new international economic order and for promoting the prosperity and growth of world economy .</seg>
<seg id=756>the chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property .</seg>
<seg id=757>in the early days of reform and opening - up , our country began to set up an intellectual property system . over 20 years of endeavor it has already formed a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property and has forged a protection system of such rights which combines judiciary means with administrative execution of laws . lots of work has been done in this regard and we have made important contribution to the progress of science and technology and the development of society and economy .</seg>
<seg id=758>in the 21st century humankind enters a society of information . the technological revolution will propel the development of social productive forces with tremendous driving force .</seg>
<seg id=759>to further improve the intellectual property system of our country and intensify international exchange and cooperation in the protection of intellectual property are the requirements of the further opening - up to the outside world of our country in the new century , and are also the necessity for building a modern socialist country and achieving the great renewal of the chinese nation .</seg>
<seg id=760>we are willing to work together with other countries in the world in order to establish a just and reasonable intellectual property system conducive to promoting the development of technology and economy in all countries and to create a good environment in which the whole humankind respects knowledge , advocates science and protects intellectual property .</seg>
<seg id=761>currently , the first most important task confronting shanghai cooperation organization is to speedup the mechanism construction of the organization .</seg>
<seg id=762>through the efforts of various parties , great progress has been made in the preparation for the establishment of its secretariat and regional anti-terror organ .</seg>
<seg id=763>we will make persistent efforts to make sure that the secretariat will start to operate within this year and the regional anti-terror organ will be set up as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=764>to display the highest attention for shanghai cooperation organization , the chinese government as the host country of the secretariat will provide the secretariat with offices free of charge .</seg>
<seg id=765>in the future we will continue to give energetic support so that the secretariat may work smoothly .</seg>
<seg id=766>it has always been the focus of the work of shanghai cooperation organization to deepen and expand the security cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=767>as for the " 3 gangs of forces " which threaten the interest of the member countries , we will never relax our vigilance and will never appease or tolerate them .</seg>
<seg id=768>we should work hard ceaselessly to eradicate such forces to ensure peace and stability of the region .</seg>
<seg id=769>to cut off the financial supply for " the 3 gangs of forces " and crack down on them more extensively and effectively , we should put the anti-drug issue on the agenda of security cooperation as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=770>economic cooperation is the basis and the priority orientation of shanghai cooperation organization .</seg>
<seg id=771>education serves as the foundation stone of modern civilization .</seg>
<seg id=772>educational cause must be developed on a large scale if we wish to promote the qualities of our people and increase the overall national strength .</seg>
<seg id=773>the rural education has extensive influence . it has a bearing on the rural economy and the development of the whole society .</seg>
<seg id=774>great changes have taken place in both cities and rural areas since reform and opening - up started . this is closely associated with education , especially rural education .</seg>
<seg id=775>the implementation of the household contract responsibility system in the countryside greatly emancipated the productive forces .</seg>
<seg id=776>one of the fundamental reasons why advanced practical technology has been successfully applied on large areas , why rural enterprises have developed vigorously and why surplus labor force from rural areas has migrated in large number to coastal regions and cities and towns lies in the fact that hundreds of millions of rural laborers who have completed their compulsory education serve as the foundation and support . the popularization of compulsory education in the countryside has scored great achievements which can not be ignored .</seg>
<seg id=777>presently , the agriculture and rural economy of our country are at a key developing moment . the development of quality , efficient , ecological and safe agriculture , the expansion of management of agricultural industrialization , the transfer of rural surplus labor force , etc. all call for the overall promotion of qualities of rural laborers .</seg>
<seg id=778>the rise of the new technological revolution in the world and the drive to build a well - off society in a comprehensive way set higher demands for the scientific and cultural qualities and the ideological morals of the rural population .</seg>
<seg id=779>an overall well - off society is impossible without the popularization of the 9 - year compulsory education in the countryside and without the overall promotion of qualities of peasants .</seg>
<seg id=780>we must be fully aware of the basic , leading and comprehensive role of the rural education in the building of an overall well - to - do society .</seg>
<seg id=781>advisors and distinguished guests attending the meeting include senior executives of transnational corporations , economic experts of international stature and scholars of great attainments .</seg>
<seg id=782>i am deeply impressed by the sincere cooperative spirit and practical attitude of the advisors .</seg>
<seg id=783>to bring into full play our cooperative spirit and collective wisdom not only benefits the planning and promotion of guangdong development but also is conducive to enhancing the cooperation and development between us in various fields .</seg>
<seg id=784>i have been looking forward to the convening of 2003 guandong international advisory conference on economy and development so that i could hear and get to know your real and penetrating views about the economic and social development of guangdong province .</seg>
<seg id=785>we gather here today with but one aim , i.e. to strengthen our cooperation and exchange , to expand room for development , to add vigor to the economic and social development in guangdong , and also to create opportunities for the advancement of your careers .</seg>
<seg id=786>china 's entry into wto marks an entirely new phase of opening up to the outside world . we are participating in the international competition on a larger scope , in wider fields and on a higher level .</seg>
<seg id=787>guangdong , a province on the mainland with the highest level of opening to the outside in economy , has led china in experiencing the unprecedented developing opportunities and severe challenges .</seg>
<seg id=788>against such a large background , we must firmly seize the new opportunity , meet the new challenge , increase the overall international competitive power , promote the modernization actively , work hard to score new achievements in economic cooperation , and to achieve mutual complement of advantages , mutual benefits , long - term cooperation and joint development .</seg>
<seg id=789>guangdong people are concentrating their efforts in building an all - round well - off society and speeding up their pace of modernization . this will provide more opportunities and more room of development for all our friends .</seg>
<seg id=790>the guangdong economy , with great vigor and bright prospects , is marching to a new high with a dynamic stance .</seg>
<seg id=791>a few days ago , the provisional governing council of iraq and the us occupying authorities concluded an agreement in baghdad , announcing a schedule of returning power to iraq by june next year step by step .</seg>
<seg id=792>this agreement is recognized and accepted by the international community with some reservation . although the foreign minister of eu expressed his welcome , france thinks " the process is too slow " . while the un secretary general annan " feels encouraged " by the plan of turning over the power , meanwhile , he indicates that " time is not mature " for un to play its role in iraq . russia simply doubts the legality of the agreement .</seg>
<seg id=793>the iraqi public are apathetic in response . the us public opinion even believes " it is a great gamble . "</seg>
<seg id=794>in short people half believe and half doubt it . they adopt a " wait - and - see " attitude .</seg>
<seg id=795>it is not without reason that the international community is dubious about it .</seg>
<seg id=796>because people see that handing over the power is something us has to do , the power transfer can never be complete , which will inevitably leave behind many foreshadowing .</seg>
<seg id=797>first , the interim transitional government to be established by may next year will not be directly elected by the iraqi people , but by " the transitional national congress " which will be elected by 18 provincial election committees .</seg>
<seg id=798>this can hardly avoid the suspicion that us controls the whole process . its legality will be doubted .</seg>
<seg id=799>secondly , us has announced that the us troops will not withdraw after the handover . they will only replace " military occupation " with " military presence " .</seg>
<seg id=800>the american government announced on november 18 that it imposes quota limit on 3 imported chinese fabrics of knit fabrics , bras and dressing gowns .</seg>
<seg id=801>at a time when china is making persistent efforts to promote the sino - american trade cooperation , this trade protectionism measure by us is unavoidably disappointing .</seg>
<seg id=802>today when economic globalization is progressing fast , the reimposing of limit on chinese textiles by the us government is out of accord with the times .</seg>
<seg id=803>first , this abuse of " quota " measure hinders the implementation of the wto principle of free trade .</seg>
<seg id=804>talking in a high - sounding way about " free trade " on the one hand , us resorts to underhand means by imposing " quotas " and builds the trade barrier again . does it not seem too arbitrary and unfair ?</seg>
<seg id=805>secondly , the " quota " hinders the positive development of the sino - american economic and trade relations .</seg>
<seg id=806>since china and us arrived at an agreement about china 's accession to wto in 1999 , the american export to china has grown by 15% each year on an average .</seg>
<seg id=807>from january to september this year the american export to china grew by 26.2% compared with the same period last year .</seg>
<seg id=808>in the past 2 years the american export of textile raw materials and finished products to china grew by a big margin .</seg>
<seg id=809>in fact today 's china is the one to which the us export grows fastest in the world .</seg>
<seg id=810>bush failed to achieve his purpose in visiting britain . there are many reasons for this . the most important reason is that us became the sole super-power after the cold war was over . it regards all the other countries as insignificant and its unilateralism keeps expanding .</seg>
<seg id=811>us , without being authorized by un , launched the war against iraq . it does not respect the opinions of its main allies on important international issues like the reconstruction of iraq . it enrages most of the countries by doing things at its own will .</seg>
<seg id=812>a public opinion poll released by the commission of the european communities shows that 68% of the eu citizens do not think us had ample reason to launch the iraq war and 53% believe that us has posed a threat to world peace .</seg>
<seg id=813>secondly , us stresses the importance of fighting against terrorism and demands its allies to contribute troops and money . but it ignores the issues of their concern .</seg>
<seg id=814>the us takes a tight control of the reconstruction projects of iraq . it granted the major projects of the first bidding to the companies of its own country and refused to share . as for the dispute over steel trade , the wto has made its arbitrary decision that the us high tariff has violated the rules . the british business circles wished bush to yield , but he did not give an explicit answer in the end .</seg>
<seg id=815>thirdly , us imposes the values of its own country on others as the highest principles and insists on democratic transformation of the middle east countries . this has met with opposition and some of its allies demand us to respect the culture and characteristics of the islamic countries . they think that the reason why us troops are caught in the quagmire of iraq lies in its " failure to respect " it .</seg>
<seg id=816>however , bush won n't change because of extensive criticism and opposition . during his visit he defended his policies towards iraq once again and emphasized that us and british coalition forces would deal with violence incidents with military force .</seg>
<seg id=817>since bush did not fulfil his wish in this visit , the iraqi situation will not necessarily develop as the white house wishes .</seg>
<seg id=818>after a dispute as long as half a year , the advance unit of japan self defense forces finally left for iraq at the end of 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=819>this is the first time after the second world war for japan to send its troops overseas .</seg>
<seg id=820>it reflects the will of japan to become a political and military power . it also indicates a change of the defense strategy of japan .</seg>
<seg id=821>the reason why this movement of japan self defense forces is conspicuous is that it is not an isolated event .</seg>
<seg id=822>taking advantage of the afghani war , japan made a breakthrough in sending its self defense forces to other countries . also by taking advantage of the korean peninsula issue , japan passed " emergency legislation " which leaves foreshadowing for the self defense forces to take pre-emptive actions . recently koizumi 's cabinet has passed " the essential plan of assisting iraq reconstruction projects , " which leaves foreshadowing for sending the soldiers to iraq .</seg>
<seg id=823>step by step japan has broken through the limit set by japan 's peace constitution and has sent its troops to the overseas battlefields .</seg>
<seg id=824>besides , japan is planning to revise the " nation 's basic defense framework " in 2004 so as to make its sending troops overseas legalized and permanent . it also plans to establish a non-provisional " permanent troops " for the purpose of operation in other countries .</seg>
<seg id=825>at the same time the japanese cabinet , on the pretext of the so - called " north korean missile threat " , has made the decision to start mapping out its missile defensive system in early 2004 . it has also introduced from us the " standard missile - 3 " and the " patriot missile - 3 " in order to intercept those missiles outside or returning to atmosphere . so a double missile intercepting network has been formed .</seg>
<seg id=826>it is not difficult to figure out that japan self defense forces is developing towards a regular army which " combines offence with defense " . the " self defense forces " which " is solely engaged in defense " will cease to exist except in name .</seg>
<seg id=827>these acts of japan are noticeable primarily because these military decisions are great impact on japan 's peace constitution .</seg>
<seg id=828>koizumi was interviewed by japanese journalists after visiting yasukuni shrine and tried to justify his act .</seg>
<seg id=829>his explanation is self-contradictory and does not hold water .</seg>
<seg id=830>when asked by the journalists why he visited the yasukuni shrine , koizumi answered : " japan 's peace and prosperity is realized on the basis of war victims .</seg>
<seg id=831>my visit is to appeal for japan 's peace and prosperity . "</seg>
<seg id=832>let 's ask koizumi whether or not the so - called " war victims " included such first - class war criminals as hideki tojo ?</seg>
<seg id=833>could it be said that the post-war peace and prosperity in japan was also including the contribution on the basis of first - class war criminals ?</seg>
<seg id=834>some journalist asked him why he chose january 1 to visit the shrine ?</seg>
<seg id=835>koizumi answered that it is a tradition in japan to visit the shrine on january 1 . many people visit the shrine on this day .</seg>
<seg id=836>it is understandable that common people mourn over the death of their relatives and friends . and many mourners explicitly say that their visit is to mourn their deceased relatives and friends and they are opposed to enshrining and worshipping first - class war criminals at yasukuni shrine .</seg>
<seg id=837>the chinese people are reasonable . we have always insisted that japanese people should be separated from a few militarists and the common people should be differentiated from right - wingers . the visit of yasukuni shrine by the common people is not the crux of the historical problems .</seg>
<seg id=838>unity is strength .</seg>
<seg id=839>this is an irrefutable truth .</seg>
<seg id=840>to realize the grand goal of building a well - off society in an all - round way and to complete the sacred cause of the renaissance of the chinese nation , we must unite with all the forces that can be united .</seg>
<seg id=841>the work of the patriotic united front and the people 's political consultative at the new stage of the new century must have this as their point of departure and point of conclusion .</seg>
<seg id=842>we must persist in and continue to improve the multi-party cooperation and political consultative system under the leadership of the chinese communist party , further consolidate and develop the patriotic united front and mobilize all the positive factors in the most extensive manner and to the fullest extent , so as to keep adding new forces to the great renaissance of the chinese nation .</seg>
<seg id=843>in the past year the people 's political consultative conference , firmly seizing the two themes of unity and democracy , earnestly performed its various function and played an important role in promoting our country 's economic and social progress and in maintaining the stability of reform and development .</seg>
<seg id=844>in the new year we hope that the people 's political consultative conference will , centering close on the central task of the party and the state , continue to do a good job in political consultation , democratic supervision and participation in the administration and discussion of the state affairs , carry on in - depth investigation by bringing its own advantages into full play , offer advice and suggestions and make more contribution to the drive of building an all - round well - off society .</seg>
<seg id=845>from january 4th to 6th , the 12th summit of south asian association for regional cooperation ( saarc ) which had been delayed for a whole year was convened in islamabad , the summit adopted such documents as " framework agreement on south asia free trade area " , " additional protocol to the saarc convention on suppression of terrorism " , " saarc social charter " , etc. they made it public that the countries of saarc will be committed to joint development and cooperation in such fields as economy , culture , the fight against terrorism , etc.</seg>
<seg id=846>during the summit the meeting between the indian prime minister vajpayee and the pakistani president musharraf was especially conspicuous .</seg>
<seg id=847>at the last summit , people did not expect much about the relations between the two countries when they saw the handshake between musharraf and vajpayee .</seg>
<seg id=848>after two years , the tension between the 2 countries keeps relaxing and the highest level meeting between them at last took place at the summit due to a series of important measures like normalization of their diplomatic relation , resumption of air and land communication , the cease fire in kashmir region , etc.</seg>
<seg id=849>a stride has been taken by the 2 countries in improving their bilateral relations . the cooperation in south asian region is greeting a new turn for the better .</seg>
<seg id=850>although the indian foreign minister sinha said on 4th that the meeting was " courtesy " , people believe that the india - pakistan relationship keeps being adjusted to be more positive and more practical .</seg>
<seg id=851>leaders of the 2 countries have come to realize that tension and conflict do not conform to the interest of their countries and instead make them lose one opportunity after another for economic development .</seg>
<seg id=852>with the further development of economic globalization , to strengthen cooperation and vitalize economy has become the pressing matter of the moment for the 2 countries .</seg>
<seg id=853>although the result of the georgian president election held on 4th has not been made public , the victory of national movement party leader and the candidate jointly recommended by right - wing parties saakashvili is already a foregone conclusion .</seg>
<seg id=854>the georgian central election committee announced on 7th that the statistics of 89% of ballots shows that 95% of the voters support saakashvili .</seg>
<seg id=855>state heads of some cis countries have already sent congratulation messages to this young statesman .</seg>
<seg id=856>in fact on the very night when the election was over , saakashvili already announced himself to be the winner .</seg>
<seg id=857>he called the result " a victory of the people " and said the georgia will take prompt action to create new prospects .</seg>
<seg id=858>many voters say , when interviewed by news media , that the ballots cast to saakashvili mean the choice of " new hope " .</seg>
<seg id=859>even shevardnadze , former president who was compelled to resign , expressed his support for his political opponent , praising him to be " young , vigorous and well educated " .</seg>
<seg id=860>while placing hope on him , people also notice that the situation in georgia has not changed much in the 2 months since shevardnadze resigned .</seg>
<seg id=861>it may well say that the newly elected president will meet the same old problems .</seg>
<seg id=862>the past year was an important and unusual year in the course of the development of our country .</seg>
<seg id=863>we carried out an extremely hard and bitter struggle against sars which took us by surprise and scored phasic victory . our economy kept growing and the per capital gdp exceeded 1,000 usd , which marks a new stage . shenzhou 5 successfully completed a manned spaceflight , materializing the dream of the chinese nation to fly to the space . the whole nation is united , society is progressing and people 's livelihood keeps improving .</seg>
<seg id=864>in achieving the remarkable successes in various fields , the chinese people have done painstaking work and displayed great courage and strength and the undaunting spirit in face of difficulties .</seg>
<seg id=865>looking forward to the new year we are full of confidence and hope .</seg>
<seg id=866>judging from the world and domestic situation , we are now at an important moment of strategic opportunity which we must firmly seize and in which we can achieve a lot .</seg>
<seg id=867>we should persist in guiding our work with the important thought of " three represents " put forward by deng xiaoping , implement in an all - round way the decisions made at the 16th national party congress and its 3rd plenary session , put into practice the important policies and overall arrangements worked put by the party central committee for the work of this year and continue to promote reform , opening - up and the construction of modernization .</seg>
<seg id=868>to do a good job of this year 's work we must have the right judgement of the situation and see not only favorable conditions and new opportunities but also unfavorable conditions and new challenges . we must enhance our sense of responsibility , sense of urgency and awareness of difficulties and danger ahead .</seg>
<seg id=869>the 3 - party talk on iraqi issue was held at the new york un headquarters on 19 . the un secretary general annan , provisional governing council of iraq and the interim authority of the british and us coalition forces had a discussion mainly on how un plays its role in the reconstruction of iraq .</seg>
<seg id=870>the discussion involves the politics , humanity and security of iraq and the special envoy to be sent to iraq by un . the 3 parties had a frank exchange of views .</seg>
<seg id=871>the plan of britain and america to hand over power in iraq is facing resistance . it naturally arrests the attention of the world whether or not and how un will play its part in the cause of iraq reconstruction .</seg>
<seg id=872>since early may last year us declared the main military operations in iraq were over , the situation in the country has been keeping shaky and unstable . the anti-occupation attacks popped up one after another , causing great casualties of the us - british coalition troops and unpeaceful everyday .</seg>
<seg id=873>the former iraqi president saddam was caught on december 13 last year , but the us rapture did not last long and the security situation was not improved . the intensified activities of the resistance movement put the occupying authorities in a dilemma .</seg>
<seg id=874>on the other hand the iraqi public and the arab countries unanimously demand the withdrawal of foreign troops and returning of power to iraqi people so that the iraqi people can run their own country .</seg>
<seg id=875>in the meanwhile us and britain try hard to remold iraq according to their will and thence get out of this quagmire " in a dignified way " .</seg>
<seg id=876>therefore , the way and process of the handover has become the focus of present iraqi issues .</seg>
<seg id=877>the handover proposal jointly put forward by the us - british authorities and the provisional governing council of iraq is like this : a provisional and transitional government should be formed before july 1 this year through election by " transitional national congress " , but the deputies to attend the congress shall be appointed by " provincial election committees " .</seg>
<seg id=878>but the shiahs who constitute the majority of the iraqi population stress that direct general election should be held to return power to the iraqi people in a really fair manner .</seg>
<seg id=879>the recent visit to russia by the us secretary of state powell is still the focus of attention of public opinions .</seg>
<seg id=880>one reason is that us and russia are powers that play decisive roles in the world and their relation has profound influence on world issues .</seg>
<seg id=881>what 's more important is that powell 's visit to moscow has substantial content and sends a clear signal : the sky of russia - american relations is overcast .</seg>
<seg id=882>if the dark clouds are not dispelled , the relationship between the 2 countries will become gloomy .</seg>
<seg id=883>although the dialogue channel between washington and moscow is open and unimpeded , powell has decided to clarify his stand by publishing an article on " information " , a very influential newspaper in moscow .</seg>
<seg id=884>in the article powell points out that us feels perplexed at a series of events in the fields of russian internal affairs and diplomacy .</seg>
<seg id=885>he thinks that the russian political power is not checked by law and such key elements of a citizen society as press freedom and development of political parties are not fixed enough .</seg>
<seg id=886>the russian policy towards chechnya and its attitude to the neighboring countries of cis worries us even more .</seg>
<seg id=887>in the eyes of diplomats it is the " last resort " of information communication to openly express his views through mass media .</seg>
<seg id=888>the purpose of such a decision by us affords food for thought . it is evident that russia feels embarrassed and unhappy about this .</seg>
<seg id=889>( international ) spread of influenza has reached its summit in america</seg>
<seg id=890>xinhua news agency in los angeles on dec . 31st ( reporter yan liang ) the us center for disease control and prevention said on 31st that the great influenza whose scale has not been seen for 30 years has reached its highest point . large spread of the disease is found in 45 of the us 50 states and death cases caused by influenza grow drastically .</seg>
<seg id=891>according to the statistics of the center by december 20th , the deaths caused by influenza already account for 7.8% of all deaths , a record high .</seg>
<seg id=892>at least 42 children have died of influenza in all over the states . deaths of adults grow quickly , but no accurate statistics is available .</seg>
<seg id=893>according to experts , there are 2 reasons for the quick spread of influenza in 2003 . first , the influenza virus is not the " panama a virus " of the past few years and the vaccines produced earlier cannot effectively prevent it . second , two major vaccine manufacturers have reduced their production down to 83 million shots this year because of surplus last year . this has resulted in the short supply of vaccines .</seg>
<seg id=894>although 36,000 people die of influenza and 114,000 people are hospitalized because of the disease each year on an average , such a influenza spread that has caused social panic is rare .</seg>
<seg id=895>according to william thompson , an expert of epidemics , this influenza is the most serious in recent 30 years . it came earlier than the past and large - scale spread occurred in many schools . there are long queues in the place where vaccines are injected against influenza .</seg>
<seg id=896>facing such a severe situation , the american health ministry launched its emergency treatment center on december 19 and dispatched its expert groups to the states .</seg>
<seg id=897>recently , highly infectious epidemic cases of bird flu erupted one after another in some regions of our country .</seg>
<seg id=898>the party central committee and the state council attach great importance to this and have promptly made a series of important decisions , explicitly putting forward guidelines and policy measure for the work of prevention .</seg>
<seg id=899>the local government and relevant departments immediately go into action to prevent the spread of the epidemic in accordance with the plan and arrangements of the party central committee and the state council .</seg>
<seg id=900>presently , the national prevention of bird flue is going on at a quick pace and in an orderly way .</seg>
<seg id=901>the bird flue is a fast - spreading and very harmful animal disease which harms animal husbandry greatly and poses a great threat the health and safety of the people .</seg>
<seg id=902>to effectively prevent and cure the highly infectious bird flue has a bearing on the health and safety of the broad masses , on the agricultural development and the income increase of peasants , on the economic development of the whole nation and on social stability . the local governments and relevant departments should , guided by the important thought of " 3 represents " and in accordance with " law of the people 's republic of china on prevention of animal epidemics " , strengthen leadership and coordination , mobilize the people in scientific and legal prevention campaign , take actions without hesitation , carry out all preventive measures to the letter with the spirit of responsibility to the people and finally win the blocking action of bird flue prevention .</seg>
<seg id=903>as the biggest debtor country , us has additional amount to its debt .</seg>
<seg id=904>the us department of finance announced on january 16 that by the end of september last year the total amount of debt america owed foreign creditors had added up to 6,494,000 million usd , a 2.2% growth over the figure published last time .</seg>
<seg id=905>on an average , every american has a foreign debt of 20,000 usd .</seg>
<seg id=906>what a coinsidence was that a week before it the international monetary fund had given a systematic and pointed warning to the tottering base of the us finance in a research report . it also pointed out that the us external debt which has kept breaking records poses a threat to the stability of world finance .</seg>
<seg id=907>statistics indicate that foreign private investors have controlled 40% of the us government bonds .</seg>
<seg id=908>it reminds people of the first half of the 20th century when keynes proposed the following stratagem to roosvelt : if economy is stimulated at home by deficit policy , the financial deficits can be solved by borrowing money from outside .</seg>
<seg id=909>this stratagem really played an important role in setting the matter of extreme urgency of economic crisis by stimulating " effective demands " .</seg>
<seg id=910>however , people have noticed that several us administrations have tended to use this as " a miraculous cure " .</seg>
<seg id=911>since president reagan advocated tax reduction and arms expansion in 1980s , the american financial deficit has kept growing and finally us has become the biggest debtor nation .</seg>
<seg id=912>the first round of the 6 - party talk is an important step in the process of the peaceful setting the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula .</seg>
<seg id=913>the common points concluded by the parties in the talk have laid a necessary foundation for the continuation of the talk and outlined more goals , approaches and policies for settling the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula .</seg>
<seg id=914>in recent months the parties concerned persisted in peaceful settlement of the unclear issue on the korean peninsula through dialogues . on the basis of the results of the first round of talks , consultations and discussions at various levels were extensively held and persistent efforts were made for holding the second round of talks as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=915>in the meanwhile north korea and us displayed further flexibility of different degrees .</seg>
<seg id=916>important progress has been made in preparations of the talk . it is the common wish of all countries that the talk will be held successfully .</seg>
<seg id=917>it is the general concern of all parties and the international community whether or not the talk will continue and what results the talk will achieve .</seg>
<seg id=918>in this aspect the spokesman of the chinese foreign ministry said that the aim of the 6 - party talk is to maintain and promote the process of peaceful settlement through dialogues . we are ready to work together with other parties for this purpose .</seg>
<seg id=919>the basic starting point of the chinese party is to maintain peace and stability on the korean peninsula and achieve nuclear - free there .</seg>
<seg id=920>the chinese party believes that so long as the parties persist in sincerity of peace talks , respect each other and negotiate on equal basis , favorable conditions can be created for promoting the settlement of the relevant issues .</seg>
<seg id=921>in the end of 70s of the last century the relation between us and libya worsened . and in 1981 their diplomatic relations broke off .</seg>
<seg id=922>american president reagan listed a series of crimes for the libya president qaddafi , e.g. accusing libya of secretly developing nuclear weapons , conducting military interference and terrorism in other countries etc.</seg>
<seg id=923>the oral disputes turn into armed confrontation and us launched 2 surgical air attacks entitled " prairie fire " and " el dorado canyon " .</seg>
<seg id=924>afterwards , us imposed economic sanction against libya , attacked it in politics , contained it in diplomacy and threatened it with arms .</seg>
<seg id=925>but qaddafi refused to give in though under great pressure .</seg>
<seg id=926>presently , the relationship between us and libya is warming up . some people attribute this entirely to the threat effects of iraqi war , but this seems to be biased .</seg>
<seg id=927>in fact , for years qaddafi of unique personality has been opposed to us on the one hand and kept stretching the olive branch to us which however received no response on the other hand .</seg>
<seg id=928>after the iraqi war was over , the countries in the middle east readjusted their strategies and the regional forces regrouped themselves . this provides a good opportunity for us and libya to renew the diplomatic relation .</seg>
<seg id=929>for qaddafi to mend its relations with us will put an end to the sanctions , revive its economy , improve people 's livelihood , get rid of isolation and integrate into the world community .</seg>
<seg id=930>the give - up by libya of what has not been obtained and will not be obtained in the near future can be reciprocated by a new environment  a sudden glimpse of hope in the dark .</seg>
<seg id=931>from february 7th to 8th the political celebrities from europe , america and other world regions gathered in munich , germany to attend the 40th munich conference on security policy .</seg>
<seg id=932>the so - called " munich conference on security policy " , founded by non-governmental persons of germany and financially aided by the german government , is a forum on international security issues . in recent years , especially since " september 11 " , it has received increasingly more attention and is lauded as " davos forum " in the security field .</seg>
<seg id=933>an important item on the agenda of the meeting is the trans - atlantic relations .</seg>
<seg id=934>the european and american political figures said at or after the conference that the two sides are striving to remove the shadow from the relations between the two sides brought about by the iraqi war and are working hard to return to the track of cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=935>bertram , director of berlin institute for international politics and security , said this is a meeting to mend the relations between europe and america and both sides wish to draw close .</seg>
<seg id=936>in terms of europe - american relations , good news from the conference goes that europe and america need to resume dialogues , to give careful consideration to the common tasks confronting the two sides and to find the interest converging point needed for the accomplishment of these common tasks .</seg>
<seg id=937>compared with the conference held last year , this year 's session is free from the smell of gunpowder and the position of the two sides come closer .</seg>
<seg id=938>the " old europe " represented by france and germany , though still brood on the iraqi war launched by us , says that they will " look forward " .</seg>
<seg id=939>the german foreign minister fischer said at the conference : although we hold different views about the war , we must jointly ensure that peace is achieved in the post-war iraq . for this we must look forward .</seg>
<seg id=940>he also remarked that germany will not block nato from playing a direct role in iraq although it won n't send any troops to iraq .</seg>
<seg id=941>us which leads the world in medium field has a lot to say in international press . its tentacles of public opinion propaganda radiate to all over the world and there is no place they cannot reach . then why does it spend so much money on a special satellite tv station covering 22 countries in the middle east ?</seg>
<seg id=942>just as the responsible person of " first freedom tv " station put it , it aims to provide a press platform with " all - round and fair views " for the arab countries .</seg>
<seg id=943>but some analyst point out that " first freedom tv " will be america 's strategic weapon to carry out cultural infiltration , cultural intrusion and psychological offence in arab countries . it will be an important propaganda tool for us to reshape the middle east and transform the islamic world .</seg>
<seg id=944>judging from this we see that " first freedom tv " has unusual missions . its chief missions are the following 3 . first , its mission is to spread " freedom concept " .</seg>
<seg id=945>us believes that the islamic civilization is a serious obstacle to the western efforts in promoting modern civilization . the extreme religious forces in the middle east islamic countries are hotbed of international terrorism characteristic of opposing the usa . to effectively fight against terror , the islamic world must be transformed so that it identifies with and accepts the western values , the western life style and the political system .</seg>
<seg id=946>the us attempts to instill its ideology into arabs through the imperceptible influence of " first freedom tv " programs .</seg>
<seg id=947>secondly , it aims to improve the image of the usa .</seg>
<seg id=948>us abides by unilateralism in its foreign policy . on many international issues it parades its strength and do things at its own will . its hegemonic acts enrage the arab countries and the islamic world .</seg>
<seg id=949>after the " september 11 " incident , the contradiction between us which has taken side with israel and the middle east islamic world is being intensified .</seg>
<seg id=950>us occupied iraq with armed forces in the name of destroying weapons of mass destruction , without absolute evidence and the authorization from un . this aroused strong disgust of the moslem public .</seg>
<seg id=951>the talk between pakistani and indian officials was held in islamabad from february 16th to 18th . the hope of peace rose again on the south asian subcontinent .</seg>
<seg id=952>the officials of the 2 countries decided the schedule and agenda of the future talk and build up a mechanism for sustainable dialogues . this marks the restart of the pakistan - indian dialogue process after 2 years of suspension , laying a foundation for the settlement of all unsolved issues including kashmir dispute . it embodies the valuable wish for peace of both sides .</seg>
<seg id=953>before this talk most of analysts hold cautious attitudes to the prospects of the peace process , although the relationship between the 2 countries had been warmed up by a series of good - will actions of both sides .</seg>
<seg id=954>it is small wonder . recalling the sudden rise and abrupt fall in the pakistan - indian relationship , nobody can guarantee that the sunshine on today 's talk table won n't turn into thunder and lightning on the border tomorrow .</seg>
<seg id=955>however , the foreign secretary riaz khokhar of pakistani state council announced with a smile on 18 the joint statement of the 2 countries which immediately spread the optimistic mood all over the place . it made those who are concerned with the south asian situation brighten up .</seg>
<seg id=956>first of all the schedule determined for the talk is very feasible . the two sides not only clearly know the specific time and agenda of the talk but also different talk levels are decided in proportion to the importance of the specific topics .</seg>
<seg id=957>secondly , the directly dialogues between the leaders of the 2 countries brought the talk on failed during the agra summit in july 2001 . the two sides draw a lesson from it and take the mode of dialogues by " step by step " . the talks level will be launched from low to high in order to prepare fully for the high level dialogues .</seg>
<seg id=958>thirdly , the two countries , after experiencing ups and downs in the relationship between the 2 countries , unanimously make it clear that war is not a good method to settle the conflict and both sides should keep away from war . this consensus has laid a good foundation for the future leaders of the 2 countries to reach an understanding of " no war forever between pakistan and india . "</seg>
<seg id=959>to accurately implement the policy of " one country , two systems " in an all - round way , we must integrate " one country " with " two systems " and " love for the motherland " with " love for hong kong " , unify the respect for high - level autonomy of hong kong with maintaining the state sovereignty and unify maintaining hong kong 's capitalism with socialism which insists on the state unity .</seg>
<seg id=960>only by doing this can the well - being of hong kong compatriots be maintained , which can conform to the long term interest of the state and the whole people .</seg>
<seg id=961>after hong kong 's return , the central government has stuck to the implementation of the " one country two systems " policy and has strictly abided by the basic law in its work .</seg>
<seg id=962>the broad masses of hong kong compatriots , as status of masters , enjoy unprecedented democratic rights .</seg>
<seg id=963>with the powerful support of the central government and the mainland , hong kong subdued various risks and challenges such as the impact of the asian financial crisis and has maintained its status as an international center of finance , trade and navigation .</seg>
<seg id=964>practice proves that the policy of " one country , two systems " has great vitality .</seg>
<seg id=965>today the speech made by deng xiaoping 20 years ago is published again , once again which demonstrates the strong determination of the central government in implementing the policy of " one country , two systems " . what 's more , it means to enable everyone to have an accurate and all - round understanding of the policy of " one country , two systems " and to keep promoting the great practice of the policy .</seg>
<seg id=966>today the party central committee and the state council solemnly hold this awarding ceremony of national science and technology .</seg>
<seg id=967>president hu jingtao bestowed the 2003 national highest scientific and technological awards to two academicians of liu dongsheng and wang yongzhi .</seg>
<seg id=968>the meeting also bestowed technological top grade award to the project " china manned spaceflight " and the natural science award , national technological invention award and national technological progress award in the year of 2003 to scientists and technologists .</seg>
<seg id=969>i , on behalf of the central committee and the state council , extend warm congratulations to all the laureates .</seg>
<seg id=970>and our sincere greetings and highest respect to all the scientific and technological workers on all fronts .</seg>
<seg id=971>the first 20 years of this century , for our country , is an important strategic period which we must firmly seize and in which we can achieve a lot .</seg>
<seg id=972>we must concentrate on building a well - off society of a higher level which will benefit more than a billion people .</seg>
<seg id=973>we should make best use of this period which is full of opportunies strategically and strive to achieve as much as we can . we must put the development of science and technology on an even more important and more prominent position .</seg>
<seg id=974>after " september 11 " incident the american president bush put forward the " pre-emptive " strategy in june 2002 and began to use it in the us foreign relations . and in march last year he fought the first " pre-emptive " war in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=975>the " pre-emptive " idea not only goes against the principle of international law which takes " mutual respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity " as the kernel but also will inevitably give rise to the dangerous imitation effects . the international order will suffer new turmoil because of this .</seg>
<seg id=976>in the early days when the " pre-emptive " theory was proposed , some american political celebrities asked this question : what if other countries follow the example ? "</seg>
<seg id=977>as expected , more and more countries clamor to overwhelm others by " pre-emptive " means . the " pre-emptive " troops keep growing .</seg>
<seg id=978>this is a new trend worth our attention and study .</seg>
<seg id=979>in the very month when bush put forward his " pre-emptive " strategy , the prime minister of australia howard was the first to voice his support .</seg>
<seg id=980>he said that once we have reliable information about terrorist attack against australia , australia will adopt the " pre-emptive " strategy and will take military actions in the neighboring countries at all costs .</seg>
<seg id=981>he even suggest that the " pre-emptive " principle be included into the un charter . he thinks it is necessary to make amendments to the un charter and give the right of " pre-emptive " attack to all countries so as to crack down on terrorists and those countries that support terrorist activities .</seg>
<seg id=982>in northeast asia the japanese ministry of defense proposed as early as in july 1999 in its defense white paper that japan may launch " pre-emptive " attacks against foreign bases when facing missile attack or before any military invasion .</seg>
<seg id=983>after the iraqi war , japan 's cry for " pre-emptive " strategy has caused a clamor .</seg>
<seg id=984>recently , there have been many comments on america 's present policies towards africa in international public opinions .</seg>
<seg id=985>on america 's " foreign policy in focus " published in january this year , there is an article entitled " africa policy outlook 2004 " . the article holds that the foreign policies of bush administration in the past year have brought about direct or indirect negative influence on africa . the full concerns of america were about the anti-terrorist war and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially us was involved in iraq , therefore , its attention to afirica has been diverted much more .</seg>
<seg id=986>people still remember that to display its concern for africa , bush administration last year worked out " the president 's emergency plan for aids relief " and promised to provide africa with 3 billion usd at least each year .</seg>
<seg id=987>in july last year bush visited senegal , south africa , botswana , uganda and nigeria and promised to assist african countries with 15 billion usd to prevent aids and 100 million usd to fight against terrorist activities . he also announced some assisting africa programs including emergency food assistance plan and education aid plan .</seg>
<seg id=988>these assistance programs were once welcomed by african countries and won many international praises .</seg>
<seg id=989>however , a year has passed and us has not shown any sign of implementing them .</seg>
<seg id=990>africa needs assistance badly .</seg>
<seg id=991>after the world entered the new century , africa faces various development challenges . in order to realize " the century development goals " worked out by the un in 2002 , i.e. to reduce hunger and poverty and promote health and education , africa has set up its " african union " whose mission it is to plan and coordinate african affairs in a unified way and has drawn up the " african new partnership program for development " aiming to promote the development of the countries . but because of the weak economic basis , fund has always been in short supply .</seg>
<seg id=992>un has appealed many times to the developed countries to use 0.7% of their gdp to provide official help to the least developed countries .</seg>
<seg id=993>however , the american official aid accounts for only 0.1% of its gdp , far below the un demand . it is the last one on the list of the contributing countries .</seg>
<seg id=994>recently , there has been a hot topic discussed by the european public : is the " 3 magnate " summit of german prime minister schroeder , the french president chirac and the british prime minister blair going to be increasingly systematic and regular ?</seg>
<seg id=995>public opinion calls the " big three " of germany , france and britain " a new troika " of eu . the relationship of the 3 nations is called a " new triangle " affair .</seg>
<seg id=996>" new triangle " is a new thing and we have to wait and see how it will develop . but whichever angle you judge it , " new triangle " in general is help for the process of european integration and for europe to play its important role on the international arena as a pole of the multiple world .</seg>
<seg id=997>a survey of the 100 year history of europe will tell you that a basic characteristic of the german - france - british triangle is that british and france jointly contain and resist germany .</seg>
<seg id=998>the two world wars are the evidence .</seg>
<seg id=999>during the cold war east and west germany were sandwiched between the warsaw pact and nato .</seg>
<seg id=1000>after the cold war is over , the unified germany is stronger ; the power frame in west europe is out of balance . france is more dubious and as a result the " german - france axis " was once out of operation . therefore britain and france come closer with an intention still to contain germany .</seg>
<seg id=1001>but in recent years , with the restart of the " german - france axis " and the fierce conflicts between the ideas of world monopolarization and world multipolarization , great dissensions occurred inside eu over the iraqi issue :</seg>
<seg id=1002>" the old europe " represented by germany and france and " the new europe " represented by britain and poland are poles apart in their stands on the iraqi issue .</seg>
<seg id=1003>this split occurred accidentally at a time when eu is going to carry out its largest expansion in history .</seg>
<seg id=1004>egyptian president mubarak made a speech in cairo a few days ago on the reform of arab countries , criticizing the outside world for imposing one mode of reform on the arab countries . he also warned that the attempt runs counter to its desire and is no conducive to the security and stability of the middle east region .</seg>
<seg id=1005>he believes that reform measures should conform to the specific conditions and capabilities of the respective countries . a single reform mode ignores the cultural backgrounds , social customs and religious features of different countries .</seg>
<seg id=1006>at the same he points out that the arab countries welcome outside help in their reform process , but this effort should recognize specific conditions of different countries and respect their wishes so as to promote the reform process of the arab countries in politics , economy and culture .</seg>
<seg id=1007>the remarks of the egyptian leader represent the common viewpoints of the arab countries .</seg>
<seg id=1008>at present , under the pressure of anti-terror and anti-proliferation campaign and the democratic reform , the middle east has become one of the hotspots of the world . new turmoil are brewing up ands they will lead to new regrouping .</seg>
<seg id=1009>after the afghani and iraqi wars , how should iraq , once considered by the us as " an axis of evil " , carry out political reconstruction ?</seg>
<seg id=1010>how will the various political bodies and social modes in the middle east region evolve ?</seg>
<seg id=1011>this is the care and concern of not only the arab world and the international community but also us and its western allies .</seg>
<seg id=1012>the american secretary of state powell reiterated in washington on 9th when meeting with the bahrain crown prince salman , that us push forward " western democracy and capitalist plan " in iraq and the middle east .</seg>
<seg id=1013>he also emphasized : " we are considering what else we can do and how to systematize these . "</seg>
<seg id=1014>last year was designated as " the year of culture and education " by the international olympic committee .</seg>
<seg id=1015>taking advantage of this opportunity , beijing organizing committee for the games of the olympiad sponsors a series of educational activities to spread advanced culture and popularize olympic knowledge .</seg>
<seg id=1016>of these activities , the publication of " olympic knowledge reader for middle school pupils " basically for adolescents is an important result .</seg>
<seg id=1017>this reader , with vivid illustrations , mainly tells stories about olympic games and the substance of the olympic spirit . it is a good textbook to promote the knowledge of adolescents on olympic games and to enhance the enthusiasm of the public in participating in olympic activities .</seg>
<seg id=1018>last year beijing organizing committee for the games of the olympiad designed a school timetable exclusively for adolescent pupils which was made of recycled paper and the emblem of beijing olympic games printed on them .</seg>
<seg id=1019>the concept of " green olympic " is to prepare and host the olympic games with the ideas of sustainable development such as environment protection and ecological balance preservation .</seg>
<seg id=1020>we hope that these timetables will normalize the behavior of adolescents just as they schedule the classes so that they gradually become advocators and practicers of the concept of " green olympic . "</seg>
<seg id=1021>education , one of the essential contents of olympic sports , is also an important embodiment of " people friendly olympic " .</seg>
<seg id=1022>the real aim of the olympic sports is to educate the young from a new angle and in a new manner , to promote the sound development of their bodies and minds and to contribute to the construction of a peaceful and beautiful world .</seg>
<seg id=1023>therefore the combination of sports and education not only opens up new fields for educational development but also makes olympic sports more educational .</seg>
<seg id=1024>" green olympic " is one of the 3 major concepts of 2008 olympic games to be hosted by beijing .</seg>
<seg id=1025>the core is to improve the environment of the capital by a large margin so as to provide a fine surrounding for olympic games and build up an ecological city .</seg>
<seg id=1026>to achieve the purpose environmental protective technologies and means should be extensively adopted to boost the environment control , planting trees in the cities and countries and beautify them and development of environmental protective industries extensively and in an all - round way , to enhance the awareness of the environment of the whole society and to encourage the public to actively take part in ecological environment improvement .</seg>
<seg id=1027>to do a good job in the implementation of " green olympic " is one of our major tasks in implementing the decisions of the 3rd plenary session of the 16th central committee of the cpc on maintaining a human - centered , comprehensive , well - coordinated and sustainable scientific concept of development and on promoting the all - round , coordinated and sustainable economic and social development in beijing .</seg>
<seg id=1028>we must attach great importance to it .</seg>
<seg id=1029>to achieve the goals of green olympic , beijing municipality has worked out " olympic action plan " and " plan for ecological and environmental protection " in addition to the " 15th five - year plan " and " application report " which set out new goals and plans for environmental construction and protection in the next few years .</seg>
<seg id=1030>the goal of hosting a green olympic games will be implemented in a planned and step - by - step way .</seg>
<seg id=1031>on february 25th the us state departments issued its " human rights watch world report 2003 " which once again comments from head to feet on the human rights status in over 190 countries including china , lecturing others for the so - called poor conditions of human rights . it claims that some countries are not up to the us standards and others have retrogressed in the field of human rights , etc.</seg>
<seg id=1032>of course there are countries that have made great improvement in human rights . e.g. afghanistan and iraq . but this is the " contribution and merit " of the us army which has overthrown the former governments and " liberated " the 2 countries .</seg>
<seg id=1033>what about the human rights in the usa ?</seg>
<seg id=1034>as in the past years the report is sparing of ink and makes no mention of it .</seg>
<seg id=1035>on march 1st the news office of chinese state council published " 2003 human rights record of the united states " , making up for the deficiency in the us human rights report .</seg>
<seg id=1036>the record , based on sufficient facts , gives an introduction to the existing problems of human rights in america and the us violation of other countries human rights .</seg>
<seg id=1037>the americans have the tradition of sticking to honesty and admitting errors when they are made .</seg>
<seg id=1038>the well - known story about young george washington cutting down a cherry tree is an example in point .</seg>
<seg id=1039>today us has become the world sole superpower and on the contrary is not used to telling the truth .</seg>
<seg id=1040>recently , subtle changes have taken place in the mainstream reports of japan 's media on the economic development in china .</seg>
<seg id=1041>contrary to the past " theory of china threat " , many reports in japan now hold that china 's economic development is helpful to the recovery of japan 's economy and china 's big growing market demand is an important impetus to japan 's economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1042>the us " newsweek " recently said in an article that the rise of china is an opportunity instead of a menace to other countries especially to its neighbors .</seg>
<seg id=1043>the wide - spread " theory of china threat " is being replaced by " theory of china opportunity " .</seg>
<seg id=1044>" theory of china threat " asserts that the development of china poses a threat to other countries , especially to its neighbors .</seg>
<seg id=1045>however this provocative instigation of assumption has not been accepted by china 's neighbors .</seg>
<seg id=1046>the former malaysian premier mahathir once said straight away : " asian countries need not be afraid of china 's growing military and economic power , for china does not have the tradition of conquering other countries . "</seg>
<seg id=1047>the indian defense ministry also believes in one of its long - term plans that china constitutes no threat to india .</seg>
<seg id=1048>in trade governments and enterprises of different countries regard china as their best choice to expand their markets . overseas investors of big picture firmly illustrate the " theory of china opportunity " with actions : over 400 of the world 500 top enterprises have invested in china .</seg>
<seg id=1049>china has ranked among the top countries in the world in absorbing foreign investment for several years on end .</seg>
<seg id=1050>gdp is an important macro economic index universally used in the world .</seg>
<seg id=1051>it is extremely important for our country to maintain a gdp growth in the whole process of our modernization drive .</seg>
<seg id=1052>only because the gdp growth by each percent will bring about job opportunities for 800,000 people in our country , we do have every reason to maintain the fast economic growth rate .</seg>
<seg id=1053>the grand goal of building an all - round well - off society and the strategic aim for the 3rd stage of our modernization depend on the sustained fast gdp growth to a great extent .</seg>
<seg id=1054>however , we should see the deficiencies of gdp .</seg>
<seg id=1055>for instance , it cannot easily reflect the quality and structure of the economic growth accurately , nor the social welfare level actually enjoyed by people , nor can it accurately measure social distribution and social justice , etc.</seg>
<seg id=1056>on the other hand , gdp is not unique .</seg>
<seg id=1057>in assessing the achievements of an official we should not merely set our eyes on gdp growth , but on the actual material and cultural livelihood of the masses , and also on the unemployment in the locality , social security , social justice , social order , social administration , social harmony , etc.</seg>
<seg id=1058>therefore , we should approach the gdp accounting system with a scientific spirit , a scientific attitude and scientific ideological methods and give a right place to gdp in the economic and social development .</seg>
<seg id=1059>while we must maintain a considerable growth rate , we must not attach too much importance to it , let alone being one - sided or deliberately going after it .</seg>
<seg id=1060>since the delegation of the security council visited the 6 countries in west africa at the end of last june , inspiring changes have taken place in the general situation of the whole region although one or two countries have experienced some relapses .</seg>
<seg id=1061>we are glad to notice that the sierra leone government has made positive progress in promoting the capability of the army and the police , intensifying the control of the country 's diamond , preparing for the election of local governments , etc. the un mission in sierra leone is gradually reducing in its size according to the plan .</seg>
<seg id=1062>what also inspries us is that , with the disposition of un mission in liberia , liberia is getting rid of the influence of the long - time war and is embarking on the road to restoration and reconstruction .</seg>
<seg id=1063>guinea - bissau has made headways in its political process and the transitional government has promised to hold legislature election in march this year .</seg>
<seg id=1064>the peace process in cote d ' ivoire is taking a turn for the better after some setbacks . all the sides have promised to implement " linas - marcoussis accord " and " the new army " announces to return to the national reconciliation government . the security council is considering to send peace - keepers to the country .</seg>
<seg id=1065>we are looking forward to the decision of the security council in this regard as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=1066>the secretariat , the west african economic community and other related sides are working hard to settle the problems of small arms , mercenary troops , children soldiers , etc. and they have made progress .</seg>
<seg id=1067>while acknowledging the above progress completely , we should see that the general situation in the region of west africa still has its fragile sides . especially , due to geographical and historical factors , the countries in this region are closely linked and the situation in one country influences another . the turmoil in one country may spread to its neighbors and even to the whole region .</seg>
<seg id=1068>therefore , as suggested by the security council report , when trying to solve the issues in west africa , the international community including the security council should persist in a comprehensive and all - sided strategy , i.e. endeavoring to solve the cross - border issues ; meanwhile , it should actively help the relevant countries , the african union , the west african economic community and other regional and sub-regional organizations to enhance their capability in preventing and settling conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1069>we have a consensus that children are the future of the world .</seg>
<seg id=1070>we are obliged to provide them with the best and optimum conditions so as to facilitate their life , study , growth , maturing and success .</seg>
<seg id=1071>however , what is regretful is that in today 's world hundreds of thousands of kids are still suffering from the injury of armed conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1072>what they are experiencing are turmoil and backwardness . what they are witnessing are violence and destruction . what they are suffering are injuries and abuse . what they feel are sad and helpless .</seg>
<seg id=1073>therefore , it is the important obligation of the international community to keep children from the injuries of armed conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1074>all countries , especially those involved in the conflicts , should do their utmost for this purpose .</seg>
<seg id=1075>we are glad to see that in recent years un has adopted a series of measures in protecting kids from armed conflicts and has made headways .</seg>
<seg id=1076>the security council has passed 4 resolutions in succession of 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) , 1379 ( 2001 ) and 1460 ( 2003 ) , providing an important frame for the work of children protection .</seg>
<seg id=1077>the peace - keeping activities of un take the protection of children as their important mission in some regions , including appointment of advisors for children protection and giving full consideration to the special needs of children in the process of helping the countries to demilitarization , demobilization and the plan to return to society .</seg>
<seg id=1078>some peace accords promoted by un or with its participation also include clauses on children protection .</seg>
<seg id=1079>national reconciliation is the important condition for peace and stability in the regions after conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1080>after the conflict is over , the peaceful situation cannot really be consolidated and the conflict flames may even be rekindled if the sides concerned cannot forget their past grudges and give up their past resentments .</seg>
<seg id=1081>under many circumstances to achieve national reconciliation after a conflict needs joint endeavor from all sides and at the same time requires the international community , especially un , to provide support and assistance .</seg>
<seg id=1082>for years un has played a helpful role in promoting the process of national reconciliation in pro-conflict countries and has accumulated much experience . we think that generally speaking un has to correctly handle 3 major relationships hereinafter in order to successfully help the post-conflict countries to achieve national reconciliation .</seg>
<seg id=1083>it should integrate immediate needs with long - term goals .</seg>
<seg id=1084>national reconciliation normally calls for a considerable process and it can hardly be accomplished in one move .</seg>
<seg id=1085>there should be different priorities at different phases .</seg>
<seg id=1086>the first thing to do in achieving national reconciliation is to make the former fighters to " say good - bye to arms " so as to create an environment of safety .</seg>
<seg id=1087>at this stage it is very important to disarm the former fighters and help them demobilize and return to society .</seg>
<seg id=1088>we are pleased to see that the situation in bosnia - herzegovina is getting stable day by day . the ethnic relations are further relaxed . economic reconstruction is achieving some initial results . refugees have basically returned home . and its relationship with its neighbors keeps improving .</seg>
<seg id=1089>the progress in the peace process of bosnia - herzegovina has been made with great difficulties and it is really gratifying .</seg>
<seg id=1090>we extend our congratulations to the bosnia - herzegovina government and people and we wish all the sides in bosnia herzegovina to keep on working , to further enhance mutual trust and cooperation and to advance the peace process continuously .</seg>
<seg id=1091>at the same time we also notice that the state - level organizations and their capacity in bosnia - herzegovina need improving , especially such fields as judiciary , police , etc. which still face challenges .</seg>
<seg id=1092>we hold that it is right for the high representative to regard this as its work priority in the first half of this year . we support the bosnia - herzegovina government in their cooperation with the high representative .</seg>
<seg id=1093>we believe that people in bosnia - herzegovina will , backed up by the international community , score new successes in the reconstruction of their own country and embark on the path of independent development as soon as possible so as to realize the goal of integrating into the european community .</seg>
<seg id=1094>the peace and stability in bosnia - herzegovina is of great significance to realizing lasting peace and development in the region .</seg>
<seg id=1095>china has been concerned with the bosnia - herzegovina situation and will work together with the international community in doing its share in helping bosnia - herzegovina realize lasting peace and economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1096>china appreciates the efforts of the anti-terror committee in furthering the implementation of un 's 1373 ( 2001 ) resolution by all countries and helping developing countries to enhance their anti-terror capability construction . it supports the anti-terror committee in its coordination and cooperation with relevant international , regional and sub-regional organizations in the struggle against international terrorists .</seg>
<seg id=1097>in the meanwhile we hope that the anti-terror committee will step up their efforts in assisting the struggle against terrorism and try to meet the actual needs of developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=1098>at present the issue of vitalizing the anti-terror committee has aroused the attention of the member countries .</seg>
<seg id=1099>after repeated negotiation the anti-terror committee has submitted a formal report which is distributed as a document of the security council .</seg>
<seg id=1100>over 2 years of practice shows that the anti-terror committee has faults with its existing structure and operating mode , e.g. the overburden of reports by member countries , too many meetings and documents , working efficiency to be improved , insufficient coordination between experts , etc.</seg>
<seg id=1101>therefore we fully support the necessary reform of the anti-terror committee and the package plan for setting - up of the executive council of the committee . and we wish that these problems could be well solved as soon as possible , especially the problem of report burden on the member countries .</seg>
<seg id=1102>here , what i would like to emphasize is that vitalization and reform is a continuous process . no matter what reform will be carried out , the anti-terror committee should exercise its policy guidance and leadership over the executive council and any resolution must be made unanimously at the plenary session of the committee after careful consultation .</seg>
<seg id=1103>in recent years small arms have arrested the close attention of the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1104>this indicates that all the parties concerned are increasingly aware of the harmful accumulation and contraband of small arms on the stability , post-war reconstruction and social development in the regions and countries involved .</seg>
<seg id=1105>fortunately , un has taken a series of effective actions in order to solve the problem .</seg>
<seg id=1106>in 2001 " firearms protocol " as an attachment to " the united nations convention against transnational organized crime " and the un " program of action " on small arms have been successively concluded .</seg>
<seg id=1107>they provide legal and policy basis for the settlement of small arms problem and demonstrate the determination of the international community in cracking down on illegal trade of small arms .</seg>
<seg id=1108>in the past 3 years the international community has made great progress in promoting the implementation of " firearm protocol " and " program of action " . especially the successful convening in 2003 of the first un biennial conference on small arms has given new impetus to the all - round and earnest implementation of " program of action " .</seg>
<seg id=1109>according to no . 58/241 resolution passed at this un general assembly , a working group will be set up to negotiate over an international document to identify and investigate illegal small arms . this undoubtedly will step up the endeavor of the international community to crack down on illegal trade of small arms .</seg>
<seg id=1110>likewise , the un security council has paid more and more attention to the small arms issue . it has held many discussions exclusively on the issue and passed relevant statements and resolutions of the chairman .</seg>
<seg id=1111>in addition , the security council has stressed the importance of the small arms issue while discussing how to protect civilians , women and children etc. series issues in conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1112>developing economy and eradicating poverty are the pre-requisites of sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1113>the sustainable development of economy is a material basis for environmental protection and all - round social progress .</seg>
<seg id=1114>there is no development without settling the problem of survival , let alone sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1115>to promote economic development and eradicate poverty is a road of necessity for developing countries to keep a sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1116>the development of developed countries cannot continue without settling the poverty problem in developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=1117>to make rational use of natural resources and protect the environment is a natural requirement for realizing the sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1118>development cannot continue if resources are wasted and environment is sacrificed .</seg>
<seg id=1119>natural resources are by no means inexhaustible , but the demands of social development of mankind keep growing incessantly . if the relationship between the two is not properly handled , it will naturally result in the worsening of environment and pose a great threat to human existence and development .</seg>
<seg id=1120>only by following the circular economic road which based on effectively using resources and protecting the environment can the sustainable development be materialized .</seg>
<seg id=1121>it is the ultimate goal of sustainable development to realize the all - round social progress and promote the level and quality of people 's livelihood .</seg>
<seg id=1122>a year ago the 9th informal meeting of leaders of asia - pacific economic cooperation organization was held at the riverside of huangpujiang river in shanghai . the scene of the meeting is still vivid in my mind .</seg>
<seg id=1123>today we are gathering in the beautiful los cabos on the pacific coast to discuss about the important issues of asia - pacific economic cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=1124>i am so happy to meet old friends .</seg>
<seg id=1125>here i would like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend my heart - felt thanks to president fox for his invitation and to the mexican government for its considerate arrangements .</seg>
<seg id=1126>in the past year economic globalization kept progressing and science and technology developed with each passing day , which have brought about new development opportunities for all countries .</seg>
<seg id=1127>in the meanwhile the uncertainties in the global economic development increased . some countries and regions including members of asia - pacific economic cooperation organization faced new challenges in the process of their economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1128>trade protectionism is again showing up and we still have a long way to go to effect free , fair and just trade .</seg>
<seg id=1129>the anti-terror struggle is arduous and complicated and the non-traditional security factors have increased .</seg>
<seg id=1130>this world of ours is still very unstable .</seg>
<seg id=1131>although the international community still faces problems of one kind or another and there will be all kinds of unexpected problems ahead , the trend of the day for peace and development cannot be reversed and the wish of the peoples of all countries for a better life has not changed .</seg>
<seg id=1132>this dialogue meeting has the theme of development , which is of great significance .</seg>
<seg id=1133>development is the basis of the progress of human civilization and the key to the settlement of all kinds of contradictions and problems confronting the whole world .</seg>
<seg id=1134>only by realizing global harmony , balance and universal development can the world lasting peace and stability be achieved .</seg>
<seg id=1135>we should carry out an all - round and profound discussion of this theme and work as one to settle this problem .</seg>
<seg id=1136>the fast development of the trend of economic globalization is the most distinguished feature of today 's world economy .</seg>
<seg id=1137>propelled by the economic globalization trend , the link between countries and regions is becoming closer day by day ; markets are more open ; the financial , technological and talent flow is more extensive and faster . all this has brought about an unprecedented opportunity for promoting international cooperation and joint development .</seg>
<seg id=1138>at the same time the development of economic globalization has brought about severe challenges . the south - north gap is widening ; some developing countries face the danger of further peripheralization ; economic and financial risks increase ; transnational crimes become serious . all this makes it more necessary and urgent to have international cooperation to deal with such challenges .</seg>
<seg id=1139>at this moment when opportunities and challenges coexist , we should seize the chance to deal with challenges , seek common ground and leave aside differences , expand cooperation and promote the development of economic globalization towards joint development and prosperity .</seg>

<seg id=1247>the report says that in december last year the index of service trades including retail , finance , construction and other non-manufacturing trades fell to 58.6 from 60.1 of the previous month , contrary to the estimate of economists of rising to 60.5 .</seg>

<seg id=1556>chairman yu pang chun of hong kong retail administrative association recently said individual tourists from the mainland have stimulated the consumption of hong kong . the retail business was ideal during the new spring . some trades such as jewelry , clothing , etc. have increased by 20% to 30%. the consumption of mainland travelers accounts for about 10% of the total .</seg>
<seg id=1557>he said travelers from the mainland used rmb cards , obviously stimulated the market during the spring festival . the average consumption is 3,000 yuan per traveler and some spent as much as 10,000 yuan per tourist .</seg>
<seg id=1558>last year hong kong retail business declined by 4% due to the impact of sars .</seg>
<seg id=1559>yu pang chun predicts a single digit growth of hong kong retail business this year with the recovery of its economy , but the prices of commodities will be under pressure to rise because of the increase of cost .</seg>
<seg id=1560>he believes the deflation will be improved in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=1561>( international ) denmark promulgates new act to restrict immigrants</seg>
<seg id=1562>( xinhua news agency in stockholm on january 28th ) news from copenhagen says that danish government has submitted to the congress a new act to restrict immigrants .</seg>
<seg id=1563>according to the act , those danish - born children from the family of foreign immigrants will no longer enjoy the right of acquiring danish nationality automatically .</seg>
<seg id=1564>the proposed act is the latest of many measures adopted by denmark to restrict immigrants since rasmussen , leader of danish liberal party , began to work as prime minister in november 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=1565>it is reported that the act is very likely to be passed by the congress , for the liberal party has the support of the right - wing danish people 's party on the issue of immigration .</seg>
<seg id=1566>the law requires that the danish - born children of foreigners , when grown up , to apply for nationality like other immigrants , instead of acquiring nationality automatically .</seg>
<seg id=1567>those immigrants who have already acquired nationality will be deprived of it if they commit crimes that pose great menace to the society .</seg>
<seg id=1568>in the past 2 years danish government has promulgated a series of restriction policies , including limitation of issuing long - term residence permits and restriction of immigrant 's bringing their family members to denmark .</seg>
<seg id=1569>the unfriendly attitude of danish government towards immigrants has reduced the number of refugees from 14,347 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=1570>the image of denmark as a liberal and human right country is therefore spoiled .</seg>
<seg id=1571>for less than a month after the spring festival , there have been 3 extraordinarily large safety accidents , each of which resulted in more than 10 deaths .</seg>
<seg id=1572>the high frequency and the heavy casualties are lamenting .</seg>
<seg id=1573>several months before this , the blowout of natural gas oil pipes in chongqing , gas explosions on several coal mines and frequently occurred traffic accidents had caused several hundred deaths .</seg>
<seg id=1574>china is vast and densely populated and the disaster probability is greater than in other countries . a disaster often results in dozens or even hundreds of deaths . this is an objective and helpless fact .</seg>
<seg id=1575>but common sense tells us that the death accidents in china are still too frequent .</seg>
<seg id=1576>of various disasters , fires , coal mine explosions , explosions of fireworks factories and passenger transport accidents are the greatest in number .</seg>
<seg id=1577>this gives expression to 2 facts at least . first , safety measures in these aspects are the weakest . second , people have not drawn lessons from these tragedies . as a result these accidents keep repeating themselves .</seg>
<seg id=1578>in the past when singapore was experiencing high economic growth rates , there also occurred serious fires , which still remain to be tragic memories and have swiftly enhanced singapore 's precaution consciousness of security in the public places .</seg>
<seg id=1579>china is likewise at an unusual stage of fast economic growth and big social transition .</seg>
<seg id=1580>it is occasionally heard that foreign housemaids working in the locality accidentally fall off buildings . although the number of such accidents is not abnormally high , such fall - off - building accidents run much counter to the nature of household work in which casualty should be low , considering the relatively safe environment of house - maid work .</seg>
<seg id=1581>data show that from january 1999 to june 2003 altogether 99 housemaids from different countries died from falling off buildings .</seg>
<seg id=1582>behind the figure are broken families who are waiting for daughters or mothers to return home . behind it are tragedies that may well have been avoided and is the orientation of our endeavor to do our best to reduce the regretful figure to the minimum .</seg>
<seg id=1583>according to the announcement recently released by the indonesian embassy , 96 indonesian housemaids have died when they worked in singapore since 1999 and some of them died from falling off the building while working in high buildings .</seg>
<seg id=1584>facing that the indonesian government has now and then expressed their resentment over such accidents , we have also worked out new regulations many times to exercise stricter control of the quality of indonesian housemaid in the place so as to ensure their safety . however , the problem remains unsettled . the relationship between singapore and indonesia in inevitably perplexed by the housemaid issue .</seg>
<seg id=1585>what profoundly confuses people is the fact that , compared with the casualties of foreign laborers on construction sites , the casualties of housemaids ' falling off the building are higher . this gives food for thought and it is necessary to study the background and causes of such accidents .</seg>
<seg id=1586>mr. chen kongli , a worldly famous expert on taiwan issues in mainland china , recently published his new book " observing taiwan " .</seg>
<seg id=1587>most of the essays included in the book were written after march 2000 when the substitution of political parties took place in taiwan for the first time . they reflect the author 's observation and reflections , up to the time when chen shui - bian put forward his " one country on either side " theory , on internal situation in taiwan and the cross - strait relationship during the period of the author 's " not only listening to what he says but also watching what be does . "</seg>
<seg id=1588>the articles written 2 years ago cannot be published until now . this shows that the screening procedure on the mainland is complicated and long for the articles related to taiwan studies . it shows more clearly that it is not easy for " observing taiwan " to be accessible to readers .</seg>
<seg id=1589>for a long time mr. chen kongli has always been realistic and factual in observing and studying issues related to taiwan . he has never let himself be confined by subjectively preset political frames and has endeavored to explore and find unique viewpoints .</seg>
<seg id=1590>after reading the book it is even more profoundly impressed by this characteristic of the book .</seg>
<seg id=1591>after early 80s of the last century taiwan studies became " a popular subject " and many research institutions appeared . all kinds of scholars and experts show up prominently .</seg>
<seg id=1592>overseas people normally divide the mainland research institutions of taiwan studies into northern school and southern school .</seg>
<seg id=1593>the northern school , whose stand is near to the official position , is unyielding in remarks . it displays the aggressive color of the hawk in some specific historical periods or on some important of developments political conjuncture .</seg>
<seg id=1594>and the southern school of taiwan study institutions are mostly scattered south of the yangtze river including shanghai , fujian and other places .</seg>
<seg id=1595>the japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi is accused by the japanese media as overstatement on his " educational background " of " studying in london for 2 years " .</seg>
<seg id=1596>the japanese " post newsweek " proves to the dean 's office of london university that during his 9 month stay in britain junichiro koizumi only attended several courses as a visitor and did not get any academic degree .</seg>
<seg id=1597>this scandal is covered or reprinted by chinese media , large or small , to the immense gratification of the compatriots .</seg>
<seg id=1598>indeed , the prime minister of such a country goes so far as to fabricate his educational background and cheat his own people .</seg>
<seg id=1599>it is an even greater disgrace especially when it happened in the " imperialist " japan .</seg>
<seg id=1600>however , if we approach it from a different angle , perhaps we may see some positive meaning out of this scandal .</seg>
<seg id=1601>and this something positive is something we are lacking in and is what we need to improve .</seg>
<seg id=1602>in recent years we have been advocating " honesty " and have been trying to " construct a sunshine government " , respect the public 's " right to know " and promote the " transparency " of administration . but there is still a far cry between fact and ideal .</seg>
<seg id=1603>please think , the " adulterate " diploma of a prime minister is not something of magnitude . however , it is exposed by mass media which refuse to give up half way .</seg>
<seg id=1604>in such a country , is there anything else that can not be " sunshine " ?</seg>
<seg id=1605>in evening gatherings of the election campaign , different camps would use sight - seeing buses to take the masses to the meeting place . but the recent situation is such that the evening gathering in favor of chen shui - bian and annette lu is obviously less busy than that in favor of lien and soong .</seg>
<seg id=1606>not long ago the taiwan president chen shui - bian was shouting " we will be elected " at a campaign meeting in northern taiwan , when half of the participants refused to echo him . it turned out that most of the people in the place have relatives who have invested on the mainland and they felt uneasy when the " three direct links " across the taiwan straits had been delayed again and again and chen 's financial policy had yielded little results .</seg>
<seg id=1607>except for surprises , when taiwan election comes to the count down , we can suppose that chen and lu will fail , judging from the signs of public opinion polls and illegal betting .</seg>
<seg id=1608>except for sensational unexpectations such as major split or more ugly scandal of pan-blue , chen shui - bian who succeeded lee teng - hui after arduous struggle has proved that he could not effectively win over the support of the people in the past 4 year . instead , black gold , the low - taste role and performance of pan-green have weakened the confidence of their supporters .</seg>
<seg id=1609>how will beijing treat the pan-blue forces which may assume power again ?</seg>
<seg id=1610>the first thing we should understand is that the pan-blue army which may assume power again is no longer the pure monolithic kuomintang , but a combination of blue and orange and whether or not the inner tradition has merged with the nativist .</seg>
<seg id=1611>the close cooperation in the election period should be not considered as the inevitable future relationship .</seg>
<seg id=1612>if it is likely to be elected , it will surely need considerable time to conduct internal regrouping . the legislature election which comes immediately afterwards at the end of the year will make it difficult for the lien - soong administration to make major changes on the cross - strait relations .</seg>
<seg id=1613>unless it is aware that the improvement of the cross - strait relations will add to its political points and it is sure to accomplish results in a short period of time . the most important thing is to enable the public to feel the results .</seg>
<seg id=1614>with this background in view , beijing should slow down its action of pushing for reunification so as to leave enough time for the lien - soong " traditional blue camp " to consolidate their control of the internal affairs .</seg>
<seg id=1615>more than half a century has passed since july 1945 when us carried out its first nuclear explosion in new mexico and august of the same year when it dropped 2 a - bombs on japan .</seg>
<seg id=1616>although the 2 superpowers of the usa and the soviet union had piled up in their arms race the nuclear weapons enough to destroy the whole world , both came to realize the danger of a nuclear war and avoided pushing down on the nuclear button .</seg>
<seg id=1617>after the soviet union disintegrated , the world entered into a post-cold war era and the danger of a large nuclear war was eliminated .</seg>
<seg id=1618>but at the same time nuclear proliferation has increased instead of being decreased .</seg>
<seg id=1619>such proliferation embodies itself in 2 aspects .</seg>
<seg id=1620>first , some countries above the intermediate level in resources and strength have tried every means to produce and possess nuclear weapon to achieve their diplomatic ends of contending with their neighbors , maintaining peace and blackmail strategy .</seg>
<seg id=1621>secondly , some non-state mass organizations , especially those moslem extremist forces hostile to the west , are also trying by hook or by crook to lay hands on small nuclear weapons in order to carry out bloody terrorist attacks against the west at the sacrifice of large numbers of innocent people .</seg>
<seg id=1622>such needs have given rise to brokers dealing in nuclear weapons , and the transfer of related technology and to " the nuclear black market " . their number is increasing daily and it has become an important part of the world nuclear proliferation today .</seg>
<seg id=1623>as a descend of the yellow emperor who grew up in the area around the lake area , hangjia , i still remember the rural scene and the peasants ' life south of the yangtze river .</seg>
<seg id=1624>on returning to the hometown after years of separation i find that the green farmland along the shanghai - hangzhou expressway is dotted with brand - new 3 - storeyed buildings built by the farmers themselves and there are few peasants working in the fields .</seg>
<seg id=1625>this is really surprising me and i can hardly believe that such great changes have taken place on my motherland of which i have always cherished of fond memory in foreign country .</seg>
<seg id=1626>but recently i read on the internet some reportage and investigation reports by scholars on the rural situation which took me by surprise and shocked me .</seg>
<seg id=1627>out of my expectation there is such a dark side of rural china and chinese peasants are leading such a humiliating , no rights and miserable life .</seg>
<seg id=1628>the long reportage entitled " investigation into china 's countryside " written by chen guidi and his wife after their inquiry in the 3 provinces of anhui , henan and hebei pleads on behalf of the people and has caused sensation in china 's society .</seg>
<seg id=1629>they draw such a conclusion from lots of facts about peasants suffering from oppression of corrupt officials and innocent people being killed : " approaching china 's countryside we feel unprecedented shock and pain . we have seen unexpected poverty , startling crimes , surprising helplessness , astonishing opposing , unforeseen silence and sorrow . "</seg>
<seg id=1630>this has put me into extreme grief .</seg>
<seg id=1631>as expected the malaysian prime minister abdullah announced the day before yesterday to dissolve the parliament and the new election will be held soon .</seg>
<seg id=1632>for abdullah the on - coming election is an event of great importance . for the political situation and its trend for development , it is also of symbolic significance .</seg>
<seg id=1633>abdullah took over power from mahathir last november . 4 months have passed since then .</seg>
<seg id=1634>in spite of this he has decided to dissolve the parliament and hold the election in advance .</seg>
<seg id=1635>this contains 2 meanings at least . first , abdullah feels satisfied with his 4 months of administration and is fully confident about the voting of electors . secondly , he wishes to consolidate his power through this and to get rid of the shadow of mahathir .</seg>
<seg id=1636>undoubtedly , abdullah 's abrupt decision to hold the election shows that he has had an overall judgement of the domestic political situation .</seg>
<seg id=1637>the economic situation in malaysia is good now and there is nothing for the opposition party to publicize maliciously or to make use of .</seg>
<seg id=1638>besides , since abdullah took over power , he has taken some visible measures to fight corruption including the arrest and prosecution of the former land and cooperative development minister kasitah gaddam . these measures have won general approval and the public is now optimistic and is looking forward to the future anti-corruption acts .</seg>
<seg id=1639>in the meanwhile he calls for better efficiency in civil service , which helps to promote people 's trust .</seg>
<seg id=1640>since its inception , the european union has been influenced by french politics and culture in its growth and maturity .</seg>
<seg id=1641>it seeks independence and self-reliance in diplomacy and differs from us in its approach and handling of international affairs . from this trend of the eu diplomatic policies , we can clearly see the shadow of france .</seg>
<seg id=1642>it is because of this that the international community including china , russia and arab countries wish to see the rise of eu and wish to find an entirely independent force in international intercourse .</seg>
<seg id=1643>we have to admit that since 1980s eu has been really moving towards this orientation in diplomacy .</seg>
<seg id=1644>in december 1992 the eu countries reached an agreement on the mastricht summit that all member countries shall carry out unified diplomatic policies and speak to the outside world with one voice .</seg>
<seg id=1645>but 2 years later in handling the bosnia issue , the so - called " unified diplomatic policies " met with total failure .</seg>
<seg id=1646>from mastricht summit to the present , the 10 - year eu diplomacy has yielded few results .</seg>
<seg id=1647>what 's more , the eu diplomatic policies cannot stand the test of great events .</seg>
<seg id=1648>the different attitudes adopted by the member countries towards iraqi war not only bear out this point but also once again fully unveil the fatal political deficiencies of eu , i.e. it is easily divided and controlled by other powers .</seg>
<seg id=1649>on february 24 president bush announced in the white house that he will support the constitutional amendment on prohibition of homosexual marriage .</seg>
<seg id=1650>this is a noticeable change of his ambiguous attitude on this issue for months and it represents a major political development in america 's year of election .</seg>
<seg id=1651>the constitutional amendment on banning homosexual marriage is a very powerful political weapon in southern america which is the new headquarters of the republican . but it also has its negative effect , i.e. this cultural dispute of great magnitude which splits public opinion will undoubtedly speed up the polarization of american politics all over the country and will further alienate the east and the west coasts dominated by liberalists .</seg>
<seg id=1652>for bush himself who repeatedly announced during the election in 2000 that he was " a uniter " , not " a splitter " , this is obviously an indication that his deeds run counter to his words .</seg>
<seg id=1653>besides , the young americans are more and more liberal on the homosexual issues . this act by bush will harm the long - term interest of the republican though it may yield short - term effects .</seg>
<seg id=1654>the new offensive " amendments to the constitution " by bush may be called " the scorched earth strategy " for the presidential election this year .</seg>
<seg id=1655>bush adopts this strategy because , after his position is being weaken on the 2 major issues of " anti-terror " war and economy - employment , he had to open up a new battle field on the religious and cultural themes splitting the domestic public opinion .</seg>
<seg id=1656>the us 's attitude has remained cautions till now .</seg>
<seg id=1657>in other words , because maintaining the status quo on taiwan strait can meet the american long - term goal of checking the mainland in strategy , us has to avoid political and military conflicts with china resulting from encouraging taiwan independence .</seg>
<seg id=1658>one can imagine that us cannot possibly deprive taiwan of all its space for a referendum in complete conformity with beijing 's demand . but it will adopt some warning acts in view of its own interest .</seg>
<seg id=1659>recently the american state secretary powell reiterated the us policy towards taiwan and initially expressed the us stand against taiwan independence .</seg>
<seg id=1660>this declaration of attitude is interpreted by the outsiders as a check and prevention of chen shui - bian from being possessed by the devil .</seg>
<seg id=1661>some american think - tankers with official background have made statements and us will send lots of spy ships to the taiwan strait in surveillance of the military movements on both two coasts . all this indicated indirectly that us is very much concerned about the situation in taiwan strait .</seg>
<seg id=1662>watching from another angle , one may find that , although us will not completely prevent taiwan from holding a referendum according to the demand of beijing , it feels very much worried about the uncertainties in the situation of taiwan strait .</seg>
<seg id=1663>for any large and one - to - one election , only one result will come about , either chen shui - bian will be lucky to keep his presidency or lien chan will preside over the taiwan presidential palace over again .</seg>
<seg id=1664>the anxiety is that , when information and communication are not well matched , people from all circles on the mainland are not psychologically prepared for the possible victory on the part of chen shui - bian .</seg>
<seg id=1665>if the election result is contrary to its wish , beijing will be once again put into an unnecessary and passive predicament .</seg>
<seg id=1666>an ancient arabic proverb goes : " one day 's turmoil is worse than a thousand years ' tyranny . "</seg>
<seg id=1667>is this what the northeast asian countries are worried about presently ?</seg>
<seg id=1668>i think the answer is probably affirmative .</seg>
<seg id=1669>a well - known research and development center which is near washington and is sponsored by the us government studies the 4 optional decisions on dealing with the north korea nuclear crisis in one of its latest investigations , i.e. engagement , blocking , economic sanction and pre-emptive .</seg>
<seg id=1670>the attitudes of the countries in the region towards the strategy have been the focus of this investigation .</seg>
<seg id=1671>besides , the investigation provides an analysis of the threat posed by the north korean nuclear program , based on the possible nuclear attack and its damage assumed by the neighbors of north korea and on their fears .</seg>
<seg id=1672>china and russia hold that the danger of north korea using nuclear weapons is low or very low while japan and south korea believe that the threat is considerably great .</seg>
<seg id=1673>all the northeast asian countries are in favor of engagement with north korea .</seg>
<seg id=1674>japan is for blocking and other countries believe that blocking strategy is acceptable in some circumstance .</seg>
<seg id=1675>singapore attaches great importance to international ranking and pays attention all the year round to various rankings of countries released by european and american agencies .</seg>
<seg id=1676>often ranking among the top countries naturally adds to our interest in this regard .</seg>
<seg id=1677>but if you are ranked first in everything , troubles and vexations may come about .</seg>
<seg id=1678>generally speaking , our people think that if you care too much about the ranking , it seems you are afraid of losing . if you give prominence to your ranking , you seem to be arrogant .</seg>
<seg id=1679>so people say we should be free and easy . the best thing is to stand aloof from worldly success .</seg>
<seg id=1680>as many people scorned the rankings , there appeared an odd phenomenon : people no longer regard " the world first " as a good tiding , but rather something embarrassing .</seg>
<seg id=1681>however , in the past one or two years , things began to change again .</seg>
<seg id=1682>we feel doubtful about our country 's long - term competitive power . people of all trades are worried about their jobs .</seg>
<seg id=1683>with these doubts , we can no longer be free and easy when we speak .</seg>
<seg id=1684>international competition is fierce . being too free and easy may lead to the result that others may catch up . being first in everything may become backward in everything .</seg>
<seg id=1685>on the surface bush is very loyal to cheney . at the meeting of republican state governors held at the end of last month , bush swore his loyalty by saying that cheney is the only candidate for vice president .</seg>
<seg id=1686>but he said half jokingly that as in 2000 he has entrusted cheney to find a vice president candidate for him .</seg>
<seg id=1687>cheney who has always concealed his true intentions and has held himself in low profile shows up frequently in recent days at press interviews , denying that he would be replaced .</seg>
<seg id=1688>but he leaves himself an out .</seg>
<seg id=1689>he said that he would withdraw if there is something wrong with his health or if he becomes a burden on the president .</seg>
<seg id=1690>cheney is 63 years old and has a record of 4 heart attacks .</seg>
<seg id=1691>recently word has it that the us army has actually surrounded the culprit of september 11th attack osama and waits for the right opportunity to catch him alive .</seg>
<seg id=1692>ballots will be cast on november 2 for presidential election . it is said that the pentagon has made arrangements for osama to be captured in october , making it a good show .</seg>
<seg id=1693>but there is many a slip between the cup and the lip . if osama should escape , there will be no end of troubles .</seg>
<seg id=1694>so it appears that giuliani is a relatively safe trump card in winning votes .</seg>
<seg id=1695>the opponents for the american 2004 presidential election have been determined : the democratic candidate kerry challenges the republic president bush .</seg>
<seg id=1696>before the general election in november they will unfold " warming up activities " such as advertising publicity , election debates . etc.</seg>
<seg id=1697>they will perhaps be engaged in oral and literal battles around 3 tops of war , economy and society .</seg>
<seg id=1698>bush holds that the war is closely associated with the state security of us . to send troops to topple saddam and fight terror both aim to ensure the safety of us . so he has said again and again to the american public : " we are now at war . "</seg>
<seg id=1699>kerry of course will point out bush 's mistake of abusing the wrong information about the weapons of mass destruction in iraq and sending troops there .</seg>
<seg id=1700>in economy kerry advocates that bush 's plan to reduce tax will only benefit the rich and cannot create more job opportunities .</seg>
<seg id=1701>bush shows to kerry : are the statistics of american economy on the rise ?</seg>
<seg id=1702>on social issues , e.g. relationship between male and female , bush is against homosexual marriage and abortion and is in favor of capital punishment , while kerry is also against homosexual marriage but is for abortion and against capital punishment .</seg>
<seg id=1703>for bush and kerry , how to present their viewpoints on the 3 major issues through advertisements , tv and speeches and how to persuade the voters will be their political shows in the next 8 months .</seg>
<seg id=1704>nevertheless , kerry has relatively more room to show off on diplomatic issues .</seg>
<seg id=1705>statistics show that young people who commit suicide are mostly between 15 and 19 years old , and some are the younger between 10 to 14 old .</seg>
<seg id=1706>it is generally believed that pressure of academic study is the leading cause for children and adolescents to kill themselves . however , investigations show that affection , especially love between boys and girls , and the relationship between adolescents and their parents are even more important in leading them to end up their lives .</seg>
<seg id=1707>pressure from lessons and disappointment from expectation of course belong to the category of communication between children and their parents .</seg>
<seg id=1708>pressure resulting from going to schools of higher grade is an inevitable burden on children in their development . sometimes the pressure comes from the adolescents themselves and mostly it is imposed on them by their parents .</seg>
<seg id=1709>parents demand higher academic records and often compare their children with other kids . they demand their children to do even better , which causes great pressure . but persuasion and communication behind the pressure are the thermometer that measures the relationship between kids and parents .</seg>
<seg id=1710>if the parents beat and abuse their children , or blame them by giving a black look simply because they do n't live up to their expectation , or if they make children feel they are disappointing , this undoubtedly drives the kids to a helpless situation .</seg>
<seg id=1711>it is said that many adolescents who need psychiatric help are perplexed simply because the extraordinarily high expectation of their parents has put them into an inescapable corner .</seg>
<seg id=1712>the success and fast development of singapore make parents feel that their children have far better material conditions and inevitably they think that their kids should excel them in performance .</seg>
<seg id=1713>normally , parents forget the fact that they might not be very excellent in everything when they were kids .</seg>
<seg id=1714>once one and a half years old , most of the kids are sent to boarding nurseries of departments and institutions and the authorities charge a little token money . kids come back home only once a week or even once a month .</seg>
<seg id=1715>today singapore faces the social issue of dropping birth rates and aging of population .</seg>
<seg id=1716>the younger generation are busy maintaining modern living standards and modern material enjoyments . they cannot afford to respond to the government call for early marriage and early birth .</seg>
<seg id=1717>the author has a bold proposal to make , i.e. the government accepts newly - born babies .</seg>
<seg id=1718>the citizens are only encouraged to give birth to babies . they do n't have to worry about the fostering of children .</seg>
<seg id=1719>on the one hand the government provides boarding nurseries , boarding kindergartens and even boarding primary schools and supplies 3 - meal - a - day service . it charges the citizens a little token money which they can easily afford .</seg>
<seg id=1720>this not only provides job opportunities for the unemployed but also frees the government from worrying whether or not such measures as baby awards , prolonging the maternity leave , promoting quality of housemaid , tax kickback , etc. will achieve the desired results .</seg>
<seg id=1721>what beijing needs to do is not just acting as the chief guide of the 6 - party talk but to set its eye on china 's long - term interest on the korean peninsula . it should take precautions and start its strategic deployments as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=1722>to be specific , beijing should on the one hand urge north korea to give up its nuclear arms and one the other hand , guide north korea onto the track of modern civilization through the transformation of kim jong - il regime , remove the danger of a nuclear warm from northeast asia and keep the status quo on the korean peninsula so as to obtain bargaining counters in its strategic dealing with the usa .</seg>
<seg id=1723>pyongyang , fierce of mien but faint of heart , is eager in its heart to develop its economy and merge into the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1724>but this strong desire displays itself in the outer form of valiance , irrationality and sometimes not in conformity with international regulations .</seg>
<seg id=1725>in fact , beijing has , for a period of time , used its influence and the means of economic aid to compel pyongyang to change its position running counter international rules .</seg>
<seg id=1726>but this act still needs overall planning .</seg>
<seg id=1727>the aid of beijing to pyongyang should not be confined to the economic level and should be extended to other social fields . it should not be limited to forcing pyongyang to give up its nuclear program . it should focus on guiding the regime onto the road to modern civilization .</seg>
<seg id=1728>in the early days when kerry entered the arena , nobody cherished much hope on him . at that time all the focus was on the former vermont governor dean .</seg>
<seg id=1729>but in january before the party meeting was held in iowa , kerry , a dark horse , appeared and won the party meeting and primary elections in the 2 most essential states of iowa and new hampshire .</seg>
<seg id=1730>in the following states primary elections kerry , on the whole , did not lose except for those states which had their own candidates</seg>
<seg id=1731>only in 6 week 's time kerry became the final candidate from a candidate with little prospects . all his competitive opponents were defeated one after another including gephardt , lieberman , clark , dean and edwards . people cannot but look at kerry 's political charm with new eyes .</seg>
<seg id=1732>in his 19 years of career as a congressman kerry has always supported abortion and policies of environmental protection and opposed the tax reduction plan benefiting the rich . he has devoted himself to promoting the minimum wages and wishes to solve the problem of global warming .</seg>
<seg id=1733>his working experience in washington demonstrates his courage that he likes to meet the difficult social issues head on and is brave to challenge authorities . he seeks value and is never afraid of offending the minority .</seg>
<seg id=1734>china 's reform and opening - up policy started from agriculture and rural residents were the first beneficiaries of the policy .</seg>
<seg id=1735>but after 1990s the substantial bias of the economic policies to big cities resulted in the basic standstill of the agrarian reform . the gap between the rural and urban regions was increasingly widened as a result .</seg>
<seg id=1736>as time went on , in china appear two entirely different worlds : one is the highly prosperous cities and the other is the poor and backward countryside .</seg>
<seg id=1737>to quote chinese officials , the widening gap between the rich cities and the poor countryside is " a problem in the course of development " and it can be solved by sustaining the development .</seg>
<seg id=1738>in other words china 's coastal regions and cities should keep developing and should not be held back by the rural problems .</seg>
<seg id=1739>however , on seeing small changes in one year and big changes in 3 years in large cities , people cannot help asking why few changes have taken place for decades in some poverty - stricken areas .</seg>
<seg id=1740>of course we have to admit the fact that the rural areas and cities differ in their developing ways , but the problem is , while investing large sums of money in urban construction and in encouraging and backing the rich middle class , whether or not the rural people occupying 70% of the whole population have enjoyed the same care and attention .</seg>
<seg id=1741>in theory it cannot claim that all the previous chinese governments have failed to attach importance to agriculture , rural areas and peasants .</seg>
<seg id=1742>but in the past years things have been more and more difficult and have become worse in the countryside . this shows that the attention paid to the countryside is becoming more and more insufficient .</seg>
<seg id=1743>in any country public security departments , procuratorial organs and courts are symbols of justice and fairness and are the most important system in safeguarding social stability .</seg>
<seg id=1744>but unfortunately public security departments , procuratorial organs and courts are symbols of corruption in china .</seg>
<seg id=1745>according to a report released recently by the national audit office which last year has carried out auditing of the financial expenditures of public security departments in 26 provinces and cities , the irregular amount of money had come up to 16.5 billion rmb .</seg>
<seg id=1746>the trust crisis in public security departments , procuratorial organs and courts has been known to all .</seg>
<seg id=1747>the liu yong event , sun zhigang event and the recent " bmw " incident in heilongjiang reflect this profound distrust .</seg>
<seg id=1748>the " bmw " incident is an example in point .</seg>
<seg id=1749>people give much more attention and concern to this issue than to the sars in the period of its spreading .</seg>
<seg id=1750>in fact what people 's attention focus on is no longer the " bmw " incident itself , but expresses the distrust on the whole law - enforcing system .</seg>
<seg id=1751>departments concerned are very clear about this , so before long they took suffocating measures against mass media .</seg>
<seg id=1752>nevertheless , problems remain there .</seg>
<seg id=1753>the second round of 6 - party talks on the korean peninsula issue has come to a conclusion as people generally expected .</seg>
<seg id=1754>during the talks the parties concerned have had contacts and explorations on the exterior issues around the peninsula nuclear crisis and have reached a consensus on holding the 3rd round of talks before the end of june and on setting up a working group .</seg>
<seg id=1755>but on such substantial issues as how north korea should give up its nuclear weapon development program , how us should guarantee the north korea 's political and military safety after it gives up the nuclear plan and the energy supply to north korea , etc. , not only no progress has been made but also people are made to feel as if " the fast knot " is getting increasingly tight .</seg>
<seg id=1756>the two leading roles  north korea and us have demonstrated no concessions and their bottom lines remain unyielding .</seg>
<seg id=1757>however , the fascinating thing is that us showed during the talks an attitude of not being eager to settle the problem . it gives people the impression of " procrastination " .</seg>
<seg id=1758>the tactics demonstrated by us is closely associated with the present developments of the international situation and the interest it is seeking in the new developments .</seg>
<seg id=1759>never have so many bosses been imprisoned in us since roosevelt became the president .</seg>
<seg id=1760>is it a coincidence , or have the public and investors been driven beyond forbearance in the past 3 years to the corporate crimes and other illegal acts of corporations , which resulted in the exposure of so many crimes in such a short period recently ?</seg>
<seg id=1761>the answer may not be simple , but it is a fact that the crimes of so many companies have been laid bare .</seg>
<seg id=1762>this is a good sign for economic recovery and the restoration of investors ' confidence .</seg>
<seg id=1763>late 1990s may be one of the most disorderly and most unfathomable periods in the history of american commerce . the sooner its influence disappears , the better .</seg>
<seg id=1764>when everything settles down , the names of some companies will fade out in history . and in the end , only in the textbooks of business schools ' can they be found .</seg>
<seg id=1765>some other companies such as tyco and mci will regroup themselves under the leadership of new teams and try to greet the coming of a new round of economic growth .</seg>
<seg id=1766>when will the new round of economic growth come about ?</seg>
<seg id=1767>you , as a ceo , may have no answer .</seg>
<seg id=1768>it does not matter , because the chairman of us federal reserve greenspan does not know the answer either .</seg>
<seg id=1769>the bush administration intends to stimulate economy with keynesianism , increasing expenditure ( especially expenditure for national defense ) on the one hand and reducing tax on the other hand .</seg>
<seg id=1770>in international affairs the bush administration continues its free trade policy , but the trade deficit has amounted to 549 billion usd , a new high in record .</seg>
<seg id=1771>after tax has been greatly reduced , investment and consumption do not show obvious sign of growth .</seg>
<seg id=1772>the new keynesian school represented by the celebrated british economist wyme godley holds that the us economy has been caught in a difficult situation and bush 's financial and economic strategy can not turn the tide .</seg>
<seg id=1773>they think the so - called " market rule assuming command " is but an illusion and will naturally lead to benefiting the minority and harming the majority .</seg>
<seg id=1774>people used to believe that in the entire world the so - called benefited minority are all in the usa and the harmed majority are all in developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=1775>but now it is no longer so .</seg>
<seg id=1776>many people in american economic circles hold that today winners of globalization obviously include india and china , in addition to the us - based multi-national corporations .</seg>
<seg id=1777>india occupies the domain of service economy and china takes up the manufacture realm .</seg>
<seg id=1778>people concentrate their attention on the phenomenon that large amount of the us funds and equipments are flowing to china . but they do not see the advantage of china 's high level and low income labor market .</seg>
<seg id=1779>first of all , whether the taiwan situation is within or beyond the estimation of beijing .</seg>
<seg id=1780>nobody but beijing itself knows how it estimates the situation . but the result of the estimation can be inferred from some public phenomena .</seg>
<seg id=1781>for 4 years chen shui - bian and annette lu of the independent camp have been clear - cut in rhetoric , smart and diligent in action and progressive and aggressive in independent endeavor .</seg>
<seg id=1782>on the contrary beijing , except for occasional high - pitched rhetoric , is close to routine in its attitude and seems indifferent to the progress of taiwan independence .</seg>
<seg id=1783>but since the fall last year , it has become entirely different , as if an ox - cart changes into a car . since several months ago , it has been obvious that its handling capacity is completely different from that in 1990s .</seg>
<seg id=1784>judging from this , the taiwan situation is within its estimation .</seg>
<seg id=1785>secondly , we must look at its diplomacy related to taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=1786>as for the development of taiwan strait situation , we must find out whether the attitude of important countries like the usa is near to that of beijing , or to that of taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=1787>as the attitudes of countries are open , the answer is clear .</seg>
<seg id=1788>up till now those countries become closer to beijing and have more contact with it while they get further away from taiwan and had relatively little contact with it . and they begin to give " light words and earnest wishes " advice to taiwan democracy which has been acclaimed .</seg>
