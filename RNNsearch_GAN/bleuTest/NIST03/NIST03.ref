<seg id=484>( AFP report from Paris , February 28 ) According to a Denmark research report published on Saturday 's British Medical Weekly , father 's gene may affect the timing of a child 's birth .</seg>
<seg id=485>About 5% pregnant women may have prolonged pregnancy , or to say the pregnancy reaches 294 days .</seg>
<seg id=486>It is now known that the problem will have negative effects on the health of the pregnant women and their children . However , what is the real reason is still unknown .</seg>
<seg id=487>Researchers in Denmark followed 43,000 birth cases from 1980 to 1992 . All the surveyed pregnant women had at least two children and had prolonged pregnancy when they gave the first birth .</seg>
<seg id=488>Analysis were only based on their previous two - birth information .</seg>

<seg id=490>However , when the first and second child 's father was not the same person , the rate declined to slightly over 15%.</seg>
<seg id=491>Major writher of the research report Ellison told AFP : " This is already very high .</seg>
<seg id=492>This shows that if you have the same partner ( when giving birth to the second child ) then the possibility for you to have a longer pregnancy is 30% higher than those who have changed their partners . "</seg>
<seg id=493>The research report says : " If women change their partners for pregnancy , they can reduce the danger of repeated prolonged pregnancy .</seg>
<seg id=494>We think that this is a new discovery .</seg>
<seg id=495>And this means that the timing of the birth may be decided by the father 's gene . "</seg>

<seg id=706>In the final month of last year , US economy 's driving force , consumer spending , rose by 0.9%, the largest gain since last July .</seg>
<seg id=707>Spending on durable consumer goods grew by 6.1% while spending on non-durable consumer goods and services grew by only 0.2%.</seg>
<seg id=708>This was an obvious sign that consumer spending was not strong during the US hot consumer - spending holiday .</seg>
<seg id=709>Consumer spending , which accounts for 2/3 of US GDP , saw a rise of 1% last quarter , obviously lower than the growth of 4.2% in the third quarter , the lowest gain since the first quarter of 1993 .</seg>
<seg id=710>Economic analysts attributed this to a possible US war against Iraq , stock market 's slump and a weak job market that held back spending enthusiasm , the main cause of a rapid US economic slow - down in the fourth quarter .</seg>
<seg id=711>Last year , US consumer spending rose by 4.5%, the same as that of 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=712>The report also shows that Americans ' incomes rose by 0.4% last December .</seg>

<seg id=726>Director of the Canadian Space Agency , Canada 's first astronaut Garneau , said that the US investigation of the " Columbia " accident would thwart the scheduled missions of the International Space Station with some projects likely to be delayed or even canceled .</seg>
<seg id=727>Canadian astronauts McGill and Williams were originally scheduled to be sent to space in May and November respectively .</seg>
<seg id=728>The two are now receiving training in Houston , US .</seg>

<seg id=739>However , in contrast to house construction , the spending on commercial construction , calculated on the basis of the annual rate following seasonal adjustment , was 158.6 billion US dollars last December , down 1.9% from November .</seg>
<seg id=740>Analysts said that currently , the US economic prospect remains instable and most enterprises are not willing to invest more on factories or other facilities .</seg>
<seg id=741>In addition , concerns over terrorist attacks also have negative influences on commercial construction . Although Bush signed the Terrorism Insurance Bill last November it was far from enough to remove investors ' concerns .</seg>
<seg id=742>For all of the year , the growth rate of US construction spending fell to 0.4% from 2.7% in 2001 , the lowest level since 1991 .</seg>

<seg id=844>Xinhua News Agency report of February 20 from Vienna ( by staff reporter Lin Chuan ) - Researchers of Austria 's Vienna University have found a group of nerve cells that have lasting memory in human 's spinal cord . These cells will get excited when stimulated by pains , a step forward to seek the cause of chronic pains .</seg>
<seg id=845>Patients of chronic pains are very sensitive to pains and have to suffer from pains in ordinary life .</seg>
<seg id=846>However , people know little about the cause of the disease so far .</seg>
<seg id=847>According to the Austrian News Agency , during its microscopic examination of sections , a research team led by Jurgen Sunderchaller , Director of the Nerve Physiological Department in Vienna University 's Cerebrum Research Institute , found that some spinal cord did not have abnormality in normal circumstances but got excited reaction when stimulated .</seg>
<seg id=848>The stronger the pain is , the more reaction there will be .</seg>
<seg id=849>However , different from other nerve cells the group of spinal cord cells will get extremely sensitive to pain even when the pain is little .</seg>
<seg id=850>Researchers also found that there is a special passage in the spinal cord . When the cells are stimulated these passages will open and then calcium ions will flow in and further result in chain reaction .</seg>
<seg id=851>Sunderchaller said that patients of chronic pains are sensitive to minor pains because the nerve cell in the spinal cord has lasting memory that keeps " the trace of pains " .</seg>
<seg id=852>He said that the finding could lead people to find out ways to eliminate such memory .</seg>

<seg id=318>Russian Expert : Space Shuttle Disaster May Lead to Suspension of Space Station</seg>
<seg id=319>Moscow , AFP -- A Russian space expert said that the tragic disintegration of the US Space Shuttle Columbia as it was returning to earth could lead to the temporary suspension of manned missions to the International Space Station ( ISS ) , which depends on US shuttles and Russian space craft .</seg>
<seg id=320>The Russian space expert who did not wish to be named told the Russian Inter Fax news agency that the disintegration of the Columbia as it re-entered the earth 's atmosphere could force the return of the crew on the ISS to earth and the switching of the station to automatic pilot for a certain period .</seg>
<seg id=321>He said that if it is determined that the accident was due to the age of the craft ; it will cause the Americans to freeze flights of all the shuttles to avoid another similar catastrophe .</seg>
<seg id=322>He added that it is probable that the US will not send astronauts to the station until 2007-2008 , and the construction of new spacecraft would be necessary .</seg>
<seg id=323>The grounding of the US shuttles would leave Russia as the only country which could send astronauts to the station on its Soyuz craft , but Russia 's space agency faces severe financing problems now . Therefore , a deal could possibly be worked out between the US and Russian to use Soyuz craft to keep manned missions going in the ISS , supplying the station by Russian Progress cargo vessels .</seg>
<seg id=324>The Russian expect thought that the current crew in the ISS that were due to return to earth on board the US Space Shuttle Atlantis on March 1 should count on extending its stay in the station .</seg>
<seg id=325>Sixteen countries are part of the ISS project , including the United States , Russia , Japan , Canada and France .</seg>
<seg id=326>The Russian expert said that the tragic accident on March 1 shows the unreliability of the shuttles , as Russia 's last accident with a craft was in 1971 when it lost three astronauts in a Soyuz - 11 craft on re-entry .</seg>
<seg id=327>Czech President Havel Steps Down While New President Still not Chosen</seg>
<seg id=328>Prague , February 2 , AFP -- Havel , playwright and hero of the democracy movement during the communist regime in Czechoslovakia , bid farewell to public life today after 13 years as the democratic president .</seg>
<seg id=329>In a television address , Havel thanked his people for their trust , saying , " Without your understanding and goodwill I would not have been able to stay in office for even a few moments . "</seg>
<seg id=330>Havel , who braved the stresses of high office despite serious health problems , stepped down as scheduled even though a successor has not yet been found .</seg>
<seg id=331>Speaking earlier today from the same balcony of Prague Castle from which he first addressed crowds on assuming office on December 29 , 1989 , he thanked hundreds of well - wishers , " I say farewell to you after 13 years as president . "</seg>
<seg id=332>The 66 - year - old writer used to be a dissident , but later turned into a world statesman , which also symbolized the victory of democracy over totalitarianism in Europe .</seg>
<seg id=333>When revolution broke out in Czechoslovakia , Havel , who used to be a prisoner in communist jails , became president .</seg>
<seg id=334>Three years later , Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia , and Havel remained president of the Czech Republic .</seg>
<seg id=335>Today Havel handed over the seals of offices to Prime Minister Spidla and Lower House Speaker Zaoralek , both of whom set tomorrow to share temporary presidential powers pending election of a successor .</seg>
<seg id=336>The Czech Parliament met last month to choose a new president , but failed despite two votes on January 15 and 24 .</seg>
<seg id=337>Britain Predicts Chirac Will Finally Back Security Council Resolution Authorizing an Attack on Iraq</seg>
<seg id=338>London , February 3 , AFP -- The British government believes French President Chirac will finally back a second UN Security Council resolution authorizing an attack on Iraq .</seg>
<seg id=339>The British press reported today that Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair are to discuss the latest developments on the Iraq crisis when they meet tomorrow in Le Touquet , northern France .</seg>
<seg id=340>The headline of the left - wing Guardian reads , " Chirac will change line on Iraq , predicts Downing Street " , and Guardian also quoted sources at the British premier 's office as citing four factors that would make the French president move over to Britain 's way of thinking .</seg>
<seg id=341>The center - right The Times , also quoting senior British officials , said that Chirac knew that he had already " gone too far " in his anti-war stance and he was amazed to find that seven other European countries had joined Britain in signing a pro-US letter on Iraq published last week in the international press .</seg>
<seg id=342>The Times quoted a British diplomat as saying that Chirac loves being at the center of attention and being coaxed , but he is not a fool ; it may be too much of a volte - face for Chirac to change his position tomorrow , but it is hopeful to see that there will be signs that he may move at the summit meeting of heads of state of the two countries .</seg>
<seg id=343>Nearly 3000 Troops Stationed in South Korea Are Ordered to Freeze Transfer</seg>
<seg id=344>Seoul , February 3 , AFP -- The transfer of about 2900 US army officers and soldiers , slated to leave South Korea in the next three months , has been frozen to maintain combat readiness , US military authorities said .</seg>
<seg id=345>The stop - movement order was not directly linked to the nuclear crisis in North Korea , but highlights the difficult balance the United States faces between Iraq and North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=346>The US 8th Army in Seoul said today that the rotation freeze was ordered to maintain troop levels in South Korea while replacements from US - based units were also being held back amid simultaneous deployments near Iraq and in Afghanistan .</seg>
<seg id=347>US 8th Army commander Lieutenant General Campbell said in a statement that the stop - movement order would help US troops keep their strength in South Korea .</seg>
<seg id=348>Some 37000 US troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact between South Korea and the US have already been on alert since the exposure of North Korea 's nuclear ambitions in December last year .</seg>
<seg id=349>Suspected Space Shuttle Debris Also Discovered in California and Arizona in West US</seg>
<seg id=350>Houston , AFP -- America 's National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) said that suspected debris from the doomed spacecraft Columbia has been spotted in the western states of California and Arizona too , possibly offering key clues to why the spacecraft broke up in the air .</seg>
<seg id=351>" We 've had a number of reports about pieces found on the ground in California and Arizona , " said Kostelnik , an associate administrator of National Aeronautics and Space Administration .</seg>
<seg id=352>He said a team of experts had been dispatched to various sites in those states to examine the wreckage , but cautioned that it was not clear what the material is at this point .</seg>
<seg id=353>Shuttle program manager Dittemore said on February 3 that NASA had assembled a special team to search for debris west of the parts of Texas and Louisiana where most of Columbia 's remains have been found .</seg>
<seg id=354>Dittemore pointed out that such debris could be significant because it could provide the vital missing link to the disaster .</seg>
<seg id=355>Columbia broke into pieces of flaming debris on February 1 as it descended toward a scheduled 9:16 am landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . All seven astronauts aboard were killed .</seg>
<seg id=356>Investigators are trying to understand why temperatures on Columbia 's left side spiked as much as 16 degrees Celsius in the minutes before contact was lost with the spacecraft about the time an unusual amount of drag on the left side caused the shuttle to lose control .</seg>
<seg id=357>The potential discovery of debris further west than earlier expected is seen as important to understand what destroyed the shuttle , Kostelnik said .</seg>
<seg id=358>" It would be important to see the material early in the sequence , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=359>South Korean Envoy Calls for US and North Korea Dialogue</seg>
<seg id=360>Washington , February 4 , AFP -- President Bush faced urgent calls from South Korea 's next government and a key congressional ally for direct talks with North Korea before a nuclear crisis spins out of control .</seg>
<seg id=361>A day after stoking the ire of North Korea by putting heavy bombers on alert for deployment , senior Bush aides were forced to defend Washington 's policy towards North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=362>Chyung Dai - Chul , envoy for South Korea 's incoming president Roh Moo - Hyun , stressed the position of South Korea after meeting Secretary of State Powell , saying , " We hope that the United States will take a more active role in engaging in dialogue with North Korea . "</seg>
<seg id=363>He also said that dialogue should be in an international setting with a multilateral approach .</seg>
<seg id=364>Meanwhile , the Republican Party 's senior foreign policy Senator Lugar issued a striking call for dialogue between the US and North Korea as well .</seg>
<seg id=365>" I believe that United States officials should talk to North Korean officials about ending North Korean nuclear weapons programs with provisions of comprehensive international inspection , " Lugar said .</seg>
<seg id=366>Powell 's number two , Armitage told Lugar 's Senate Foreign Relations committee that it was a question of when , and not if , US and North Korean officials meet .</seg>
<seg id=367>" Of course we are going to have direct talks with North Korea . There is no question about that , " said Armitage .</seg>
<seg id=368>But he said that the dialogue would only take place when Washington was confident that a " strong international platform " of backing and support for ending Pyongyang 's nuclear program had been built .</seg>
<seg id=369>German Unemployment Surges to 5 - Year High in January</seg>
<seg id=370>Frankfurt , February 5 , AFP -- Official data shows that bad winter weather and the chronically ailing economy pushed German unemployment up to a five - year high in January , dealing another heavy blow to Chancellor Schroder just over 100 days into his second term in office .</seg>
<seg id=371>Further more , the threat of war in Iraq further deepened the economic gloom over Germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy .</seg>
<seg id=372>The freeze on the German labour market looks set to continue in the coming months .</seg>
<seg id=373>Data published by the Federal Labour Office in Nuremberg showed that the number of people looking for work in Germany surged to 4.623 million , or 11.1 percent of the working population in January , the highest monthly level in five years since March 1998 .</seg>
<seg id=374>In December , the jobless total had stood at 4.225 million , equivalent to a jobless rate of 10.1 percent .</seg>
<seg id=375>Unemployment usually increases during the winter months for seasonal reasons , as companies , particularly in sectors such as the construction industry , lay off employees because of bad weather .</seg>
<seg id=376>But even after taking such factors into account , the dole queues continued to lengthen last month .</seg>
<seg id=377>Seasonally adjusted data published separately by the Bundesbank in Frankfurt showed that the jobless total shot up to 4.274 million in January from 4.212 million in December .</seg>
<seg id=378>And the seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to 10.3 percent from 10.1 percent .</seg>
<seg id=379>Federal Labour Office chief Gerster attributed the sharp rise in the number of job seekers to both the usual winter break and the poor state of the economy .</seg>
<seg id=380>Singapore ERC : Full Economic Recovery Expected in 2004</seg>
<seg id=381>Singapore , February 6 , AFP -- Singapore Economic Review Committee said that due to global geopolitical and economic uncertainties , the economy in Singapore will not make a full recovery until 2004 .</seg>
<seg id=382>In its annual report of economic review , the ERC said , " The Singapore economy has still not fully recovered from the 2001 recession . Our immediate prospects are clouded by uncertainties in the region , the slowdown in the US , European and Japanese economies , the prospect of war in Iraq and the significant challenges posed by China . "</seg>
<seg id=383>But there are still reasonable chances of development for the Singapore economy , while full recovery may not appear until 2004 .</seg>
<seg id=384>The Singapore government estimated that this year may achieve an economic growth of 2% to 5%, after last year 's 2.2%, but is still far lower than the average annual growth rate of 7.3% since 1985 .</seg>
<seg id=385>The ERC also recommended that the restoring of the Central Provident Fund Project be postponed for two years before raising the percentage of contribution , so as to avoid adding to the burden on wages for employers at a difficult time , help reducing unemployment , and send a strong signal to foreign investors .</seg>
<seg id=386>Yao Ming Finds NBA Stardom Comes Too Soon</seg>
<seg id=387>Atlanta , Georgia , February 8 , AFP -- Yao Ming , the Chinese giant who has become America 's newest basketball icon , facing more than 100 journalists straining to capture his every word and movement when he met the media after signing a deal to endorse Gatorade and filming a commercial with baseball star Jeter and American football star Manning , sighed that everything came too soon . However , amid the confusion , Yao Ming still showed the calm wisdom of Confucius .</seg>
<seg id=388>The 22 - year - old Houston Rockets center will start here in tomorrow 's 52nd National Basketball Association All - Star Game , becoming Asia 's first NBA All - Star .</seg>
<seg id=389>Other NBA stars such as Duncan and Iverson seemed positive lonely by comparison with this Chinese giant who has attracted a global throng .</seg>
<seg id=390>Yao Ming said , " The attention is obvious . This is only one aspect of the pressure I 'm in . This is something special .</seg>
<seg id=391>I want to keep myself in my hotel room . But as a basketball player , that is probably a luxury I can never have . "</seg>
<seg id=392>Not when your tummy is at most people 's eye level and your face is flashed across television commercials .</seg>
<seg id=393>When you are making millions of dollars and replace flying Jordan as the leading pitchman of your game , life is a blur .</seg>
<seg id=394>" Everything is happening too rapidly , too fast . " Yao Ming said .</seg>

<seg id=397>Hingis Lives Leisurely and Has no Intention to Return to Circuit</seg>
<seg id=398>Paris , February 7 , AFP -- Hingis , former world number one Swiss tennis player who dominated the women 's circuit from 1997 to 2000 by winning five Grand Slam singles crowns and eight doubles titles , said today that she had no desire to return to the circuit .</seg>
<seg id=399>But 21 - year - old Serena Williams believes that Hingis is just suffering from burnout because of her early domination after turning professional aged just 14 .</seg>
<seg id=400>" I do n't think she is officially retired . I think she just wants to take a break . I did n't get serious until I was 17 and she 'd already been around a long time at 17 . Sometimes I 'm tired too , and I can only imagine how she feels . " said Williams after advancing to the semi - finals of the Paris Indoor Open .</seg>
<seg id=401>Hingis has recovered from surgery on damaged ankle ligaments last year . This operation caused her to miss the French Open and Wimbledon , but she returned for the US Open where she lost to Seles in the third round .</seg>
<seg id=402>Her last match was at Filderstadt in Germany on October 10 last year , where she was beaten by Russia 's Dementieva .</seg>

<seg id=404>Bush Vows to Disarm Iraq " One Way or the Other "</seg>
<seg id=405>Washington , February 14 , AFP -- US President Bush vowed today that Iraqi President Hussein 's regime would be disarmed " one way or the other " .</seg>
<seg id=406>" Hussein has got weapons of mass destruction and he 's used them ; Hussein is used to deceiving the world and continues to do so , " he charged .</seg>
<seg id=407>" Hussein has got ties to terrorist networks too . "</seg>
<seg id=408>" Hussein is a danger , and that 's why he will be disarmed one way or the other , " Bush said sternly as he made a speech at FBI headquarters to lay out efforts to thwart terrorist attacks like those of September 11 , 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=409>This was Bush 's first public reaction to a UN Security Council meeting held in New York today .</seg>
<seg id=410>The meeting was centered on a report by weapons inspectors overseeing Iraq 's compliance with No . 1441 UN disarmament resolution passed on November 8 last year .</seg>
<seg id=411>White House spokesman Fleischer said that Blix had not given any reason to make people believe that Iraq is complying with No . 1441 UN Security Council resolution .</seg>
<seg id=412>" Nowhere did the world receive any comfort today in New York that Hussein has shown the inspectors that he is disarming , " he told reporters .</seg>
<seg id=413>" Quite the contrary . "</seg>
<seg id=414>Asked when the US would unveil a follow - up resolution aimed at enforcing No . 1441 UN Security Council resolution , Fleischer said it was " too soon to say " but that America would consult with its allies on the content and language .</seg>
<seg id=415>Countries such as France , Russia and China are still calling for beefed - up inspections as an alternative to US - led war .</seg>
<seg id=416>Fleischer said that Bush shares the view that military action is a " last resort " .</seg>
<seg id=417>But he stuck by Bush 's timetable of " weeks not months " before UN efforts to drive Iraq to disarm peacefully must give way to military action .</seg>
<seg id=418>New York Times : White House Developing Plans for Sanctions against North Korea</seg>
<seg id=419>Washington , AFP -- The White House is developing plans for sanctions against North Korea in the event that Pyongyang fails to abandon its efforts to develop nuclear weapons , the New York Times reported today , citing US officials .</seg>
<seg id=420>The sanctions would include halting North Korea 's weapons shipments and cutting off money sent there by Koreans living in Japan , according to the report .</seg>
<seg id=421>Pentagon and State Department officials are developing detailed plans for sanctions so that the United States can have a ready response in the event North Korea takes new steps toward developing nuclear weapons , the report said .</seg>
<seg id=422>The first step , according to the New York Times , would be to urge the United Nations Security Council , perhaps in the next two weeks , to condemn North Korea 's recent steps toward nuclear weaponry , which have included withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting a mothballed reactor at Yongbyon that can produce weapons - grade plutonium .</seg>
<seg id=423>However , Washington 's Pacific allies still oppose the idea of sanctions against North Korea , and the UN Security Council is likely to remain focused on Iraq for weeks .</seg>
<seg id=424>Meanwhile , many US officials worry that if the United States attacks Iraq , North Korea will use the opportunity to push forward with weapons production , the New York Times pointed out .</seg>
<seg id=425>US Troops to Train on Philippines Hostage Island</seg>
<seg id=426>Philippines , Manila , February 17 , AFP -- United States troops are to be sent to the Philippines ' island of Jolo , which is notorious for hostage taking , to help Philippines fight against terrorist threats posed by a Muslim rebel group .</seg>
<seg id=427>" The exercise will form part of Philippines ' overall and ongoing defense and security cooperation activities with the United States , which continue to focus on increasing our ability to protect ourselves against terrorist threats , " Philippine President Arroyo 's spokesman Bunye said .</seg>
<seg id=428>" The Philippine government and US have yet to set the duration of the operation and the specific number of US soldiers and support troops to be deployed , " he said in a statement .</seg>
<seg id=429>The Philippine Defense Secretary Reyes told reporters that US Major General Weber was to arrive in the Philippines shortly " to discuss dynamics and details of the operation in Sulu " .</seg>
<seg id=430>Sulu is a southern Philippine island group that includes Jolo .</seg>
<seg id=431>Arroyo 's National Security Adviser Golez said that the exercise in Sulu would " give the Philippine armed forces the most training in anti-terrorism " .</seg>
<seg id=432>The US government has been boosting military aid to the Philippines since the September 11 , 2001 attacks in the United States , worried that al - Qaeda Islamic militants flushed out by the US - led campaign in Afghanistan could have set up bases in Southeast Asia .</seg>
<seg id=433>Such suspicion was bolstered by the bombing of the Bali resort in Indonesia last year that killed nearly 200 people .</seg>
<seg id=434>Most of the killed in the bombing of the Bali resort were western tourists .</seg>
<seg id=435>Founder of German Telephone Operator MobilCom Schmid Declares Bankruptcy</seg>
<seg id=436>Hamburg , February 18 , AFP -- Schmid , founder and former chairman of German telephone operator MobilCom , said today that he had declared himself insolvent as a result of the sharp decline in the value of his shares , and that he had filed for insolvency at a court in Flensburg , northern Germany .</seg>
<seg id=437>Schmid holds just under 40 percent of the company he set up , but the price of MobilCom shares has fallen sharply in view of the company 's financial troubles last year , which pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy .</seg>
<seg id=438>The statement said that Schmid 's private assets and property are also involved .</seg>
<seg id=439>The court had appointed auditor Gellert as administrator .</seg>
<seg id=440>Schmid was ousted last year by MobilCom 's major shareholder France Telecom in a long running spat over the huge costs of setting up new generation mobile phone networks , dubbed Universal Mobile Telecommunications System , or UMTS .</seg>
<seg id=441>In the statement issued by MobilCom later today , the company said that " the personal insolvency of Schmid had no effect on MobilCom 's activities or contracts . "</seg>
<seg id=442>The statement also said that a rescue plan , under which France Telecom would assume around seven billion euros in debts , would remain unchanged . The plan also foresees the German government and banks providing about 100 million euros in loans to MobilCom , which employs about 5000 people .</seg>
<seg id=443>North Korea Threatens to Pull out of Armistice Agreement as US and South Korea Launch Military Exercises in March</seg>
<seg id=444>Seoul , February 18 , AFP -- North Korea threatened to pull out of the armistice that ended the Korean War as South Korea and the United States prepared to launch major military exercises for nearly one month from the beginning of March .</seg>
<seg id=445>While the tension of nuclear deadlock on the Korean Peninsula is still not eased , North Korea threatens to pull out of the armistice agreement , which is generally interpreted as a response from Pyongyang towards yesterday 's announcement of joint military exercises in March by the US and South Korea .</seg>
<seg id=446>A statement made by North Korea military accused the US of breaking up the armistice agreement time and again , saying , " If the US side continues violating and misusing the armistice agreement as it pleases , there will be no need for the DPRK to remain bound to it uncomfortably .</seg>
<seg id=447>The future development will entirely depend on the attitude of the US side . "</seg>
<seg id=448>However , senior US military officials say that North Korea declared that it would not be bound by the armistice agreement of the Korean war as early as in 1994 .</seg>
<seg id=449>US authorities declared yesterday that the United States and South Korea would launch the annual joint military drills on the Korean peninsula from March 4 to April 2 .</seg>
<seg id=450>A South Korean official said that South Korea sent invitation to North Korea yesterday , asking it to send observers to the drills .</seg>
<seg id=451>The official who did not want to be named said , " The statement of North Korea about pulling out of the armistice agreement is obviously a response to the coming joint military exercises between the US and South Korea . "</seg>
<seg id=452>The United States has already ordered 12 B - 52 bombers and an equal number of B - 1 bombers to prepare to move to the Korean Peninsula , of which has been sternly accused by North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=453>Moreover , Japanese media reported yesterday that the United States is planning to boost its military forces in northeast Asia with fears rising over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program .</seg>
<seg id=454>Indonesian Authorities Reject Plan for US Embassy Security Upgrade</seg>
<seg id=455>Jakarta , February 19 , AFP -- US embassy in Jakarta requested the Indonesian authorities to build a three - meter - high perimeter wall to upgrade security of the embassy , but the plan is rejected .</seg>
<seg id=456>The request to replace the existing fence with a wall at the mission and at the ambassador 's residence was turned down on aesthetic grounds by the Indonesian authorities , the Jakarta Post and the state - run Antara news agency both reported today .</seg>
<seg id=457>A Jakarta official quoted city governor Sutiyoso as saying a wall could be built but it must stand inside the embassy compound , three meters from the current fence .</seg>
<seg id=458>In addition , the embassy should lay out gardens and flower beds between the two barriers to improve the appearance of the compound .</seg>
<seg id=459>Sutiyoso said that gardens and flower beds would reduce the impression that the US embassy is a fort .</seg>
<seg id=460>The embassy was the scene of frequent protests before and after the start in 2001 of the US - led military campaign in Afghanistan to oust the Taliban leadership .</seg>
<seg id=461>Authorities stepped up security at the mission that year after the previous ambassador accused the Jakarta police of failing to act against hardline Islamic groups which had been threatening the safety of Americans .</seg>
<seg id=462>It is generally expected that major protests are inevitable if the US launches a war against Iraq</seg>
<seg id=463>Sony Makes Effort to Push PlayStation 2 Online</seg>
<seg id=464>Tokyo , AFP -- Japanese electronics giant Sony said that it would begin selling PlayStation 2 broadband connectivity devices at stores nationwide in May to further move its hugely popular Sony game console online .</seg>
<seg id=465>By December , seven months after starting its online gaming service in Japan , Sony had sold only 190,000 of its broadband connectivity units .</seg>
<seg id=466>The broadband connectivity units , consisting of a hard drive and an adapter , are sold solely through Internet service providers .</seg>
<seg id=467>Comparing to the 12.5 million PlayStation 2 users in Japan and 50.4 million worldwide , the above sales achievements are truly out of proportion .</seg>
<seg id=468>The launch of sales of the adapter sets at retail outlets , which will be accompanied by the release of more online titles , is part of the company 's drive to encourage use of its machines for Internet gaming .</seg>
<seg id=469>" We will be selling the adapters at stores so that more users can enjoy our online games , " said a spokeswoman for subsidiary Sony Computer Entertainment Inc .</seg>
<seg id=470>Of the 874 PlayStation 2 game titles , only one is fully online - based but two others will be added in the next few months , the spokeswoman said .</seg>
<seg id=471>Nearly 20 games sold in Japan have some sort of online capability .</seg>
<seg id=472>The price of the broadband connectivity units has not been determined , but sales through Internet service providers have been priced at 18,000 yen ( 150 dollars ) each .</seg>
<seg id=473>In North America , Sony has sold some 570,000 narrowband online adapter units for about 39 dollars each which are compatible with some 20 game titles .</seg>

<seg id=475>Singapore , February 24 , AFP -- International Information Co . published a report today , saying that in the coming two years , there will be more computer program writers and other professional research personnel in the Asia - Pacific region than in North America .</seg>
<seg id=476>North America was where most research personnel gathered in the year 2001 , and the Asia - Pacific region replaced Europe as the region with second largest research population in the world .</seg>
<seg id=477>But the report of International Information said that the rapid growth of China and India would push the Asia - Pacific region to the first place in 2005 .</seg>

<seg id=481>The report pointed out that there were 1.7 million IT researchers in Asia by the end of 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=482>International Information said that the reduction in the population of IT professionals in North America was partly due to the recession in science and technology industry in that region .</seg>

<seg id=485>About five percent of births are late , which means a pregnancy lasts 294 days or more .</seg>
<seg id=486>The problem is known to cause health complications for mother and child , but exactly why it happens is an enigma .</seg>
<seg id=487>The Danish researchers looked at 43,000 births between 1980-92 among women who had had two children or more and whose first pregnancy had gone into extra time .</seg>
<seg id=488>Only their first two deliveries were used in the analysis .</seg>
<seg id=489>Overall , nearly 20 percent of the women who had had a prolonged first pregnancy had the same experience for their second child .</seg>
<seg id=490>But this figure fell to just over 15 percent when the first and second child had different fathers .</seg>
<seg id=491>Lead author of the research Olesen told AFP , " That 's a lot .</seg>
<seg id=492>It means that if you have the same partner ( for your second child ) , you have a 30 - percent greater likelihood of a prolonged pregnancy compared with someone who changes partner . "</seg>
<seg id=493>" Women had a reduced risk of recurrent post-term delivery if they changed partner between pregnancies , " the study says .</seg>
<seg id=494>" We believe that this is a new observation .</seg>
<seg id=495>This result suggests that the timing of birth may be determined by paternal genes . "</seg>

<seg id=843>( International ) Austrian Researchers Discovered Spinal Cord Cells which Cause Chronic Pains</seg>
<seg id=844>Vienna , Feb 20 , Xinhua News Agency -- ( By Lin Chuan ) Researchers of Vienna University of Austria discovered a group of neurons with permanent memories in human spinal cord . These cells would be greatly stimulated with a slight stimulus of pain . This is another step forward in seeking of the causes for chronic pains .</seg>
<seg id=845>Patients of chronic pains are very sensitive to pains , and have to live with great pain in everyday life to the end .</seg>
<seg id=846>However , people still know almost nothing of its causes .</seg>
<seg id=847>According to the Austrian news agency , a research team led by Yuergen Sandequle , dean of the Neuropathology Department of Brain Research Institute of Vienna University , discovered , when making a biopsy of tissue section , that some spinal cord cells show no unusual performance normally , but will have excited reactions when stimulated by pain .</seg>
<seg id=848>The greater the pain stimuli , the greater the reaction .</seg>
<seg id=849>However , unlike other neurons , this group of spinal cord cells will then become over sensitive to pain stimulus . A slight pain will make it over excited .</seg>
<seg id=850>Researchers also discovered that there is a special passageway in the spinal cord cells , which will be opened when the cells are stimulated , and calcium ions will get in , causing chain reactions .</seg>
<seg id=851>Sandequle thinks that the reason for the sensitiveness of patients of chronic pains to slight pains is that the neurons in the spinal cord have permanent memories and retain the " trace of pain " .</seg>
<seg id=852>He said that this discovery may lead people to look for ways to eliminate such memories .</seg>

<seg id=2>( AFP , Paris , January 2 ) An international team of scientists said that they have completed the sequencing of human Chromosome 14 that is linked to many diseases , including the early - onset Alzheimer 's that may strike people in their 30s .</seg>
<seg id=3>This is the fourth chromosome whose sequence has been completed to date . It comprises more than 87 million pairs of DNA .</seg>
<seg id=4>This study published in the weekly British scientific journal Nature illustrates that the sequence of Chromosome 14 comprises 1,050 genes and gene fragments .</seg>
<seg id=5>The goal of geneticists is to provide diagnostic tools to identify defective genes that cause diseases so as to arrive eventually at treatments that can prevent those genes from malfunctioning .</seg>
<seg id=6>The international scientists led by Genoscope , a French gene research center , said that Chromosome 14 contains two clusters of genes that are linked to the function of our immune system and more than 60 disease genes .</seg>

<seg id=21>( AFP , Sydney , January 2 ) Australia has called on the international community to work together to convince North Korea that holding Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in contempt or other " bad behaviors " will not gain it more aid or other concessions .</seg>
<seg id=22>Australian Foreign Minister Downer noted today that Pyongyang 's decisions to reactivate a controversial nuclear facility and to expel UN monitors are obviously aimed at forcing the international community into making aid and trade concessions .</seg>
<seg id=23>Australia is one of the few countries that have diplomatic relations with North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=24>Downer said : " We think what North Korea wants to do is to gain concessions , aid and trade , etc. from the rest of the world , including the United States , by violating the agreed framework signed in 1994 . "</seg>
<seg id=25>In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Cooperation , Downer said : " One point we 'd like to make to North Korea and a very important one at that , is that bad behaviors will not be rewarded . "</seg>
<seg id=26>Downer pointed out : " Such behaviors as expelling UN monitors and reactivating the nuclear facility at Yongbyon are going to prevent the international community from providing support . "</seg>
<seg id=27>" It 's going to produce the reverse effect . We hope these diplomatic measures will be effective . "</seg>
<seg id=28>" On the other hand , if we overreact , we will fall for North Korea 's trick .</seg>

<seg id=32>Bush Defends his Economic Stimulus Package</seg>
<seg id=33>( AFP , Washington , January 6 ) US President Bush vowed that the economic stimulus package he is going to unveil will benefit the " working people , " and not just the wealthy . It is generally believed that the wealthy can expect to benefit the most from this plan that urges dramatic tax cuts .</seg>
<seg id=34>Bush told reporters who are expecting him to officially announce this package in Chicago : " Tomorrow , all of you will hear me saying : the US economy is one of the strongest in the world .</seg>
<seg id=35>However , we believe the US economy can be even stronger than it is now . "</seg>
<seg id=36>Bush is expected to unveil an economic stimulus package that carries a 10 - year price tag of 600 billion US dollars , half of which will be used towards eliminating taxes on dividends paid to shareholders . He will also call for accelerating the tax rate cuts approved by the US Congress in 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=37>Whether the package can be smoothly promoted is viewed as the front battle of the 2004 US presidential election . The Democrats attacked Bush 's blueprint as an additional bonus to the wealthy , unlike the Democratic proposal which is intended as an aid to the most needy .</seg>
<seg id=38>The eight - point proposal put forward by the Democrats centers around an incentive measure of 136 billion US dollars to stimulate consumer spending which will cost 100 billion US dollars over a period of ten years .</seg>
<seg id=39>House Democratic leader Pelosi said at a joint press conference with other opposition lawmakers : " This is a fair , fast - acting , and fiscally sound plan . "</seg>

<seg id=47>However , the US delegation emphasized that the United States will not provide any compensation for North Korea to live up to its existing obligation . "</seg>
<seg id=48>The US officials insisted with carefully worded diplomatic rhetoric that although they are willing to negotiate with North Korea , they will not consider any negotiation procedures before North Korea abides by various agreements on banning nuclear weapons .</seg>
<seg id=49>The State Department spokesman Boucher said : " We are not willing to pay again for the agreements that have been reached already . "</seg>

<seg id=82>Case , who oversaw America Online 's merger with Time Warner which was approved by the US Federal Trade Commission in January 2001 , will remain as a board member of AOL Time Warner .</seg>
<seg id=83>The merger was valued at 155 billion US dollars when it was announced in January 2000 . The merger was approved by the European policy makers later that year .</seg>
<seg id=84>Case said in a statement : " As you expected , this decision is personally very difficult for me , because I hoped to serve as chairman of this conglomerate for years to come . And as an architect of the merger , I have always thought it was important that I stay as chairman and help get things back on track . "</seg>

<seg id=89>North Korea Withdraws from Nuclear Non-Poliferation Treaty to Defy the Entire World</seg>
<seg id=90>( AFP , Washington , January 15 ) The showdown between the United States and North Korea has escalated from such peripheral issues as " the axis of evil " to an international crisis , threatening to ruin decades of global efforts at nuclear non-proliferation .</seg>
<seg id=91>Pyongyang declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty on the 10th of this month , resulting in a stand - off with Washington .</seg>
<seg id=92>Analysts said that at present , the global efforts aimed at nuclear non-proliferation are threatened with failure . The treaty has already been seriously undermined when the non-signatories India and Pakistan joined the nuclear club in 1998 .</seg>
<seg id=93>Four days after Pyongyang made the above move , five permanent members of the UN Security Council have all taken preventive diplomatic actions on this crisis .</seg>
<seg id=94>Russia said it will send a special envoy to Pyongyang to suggest an end to this stalemate , while China proposed that the United States and North Korea hold a dialog to reach a compromise .</seg>
<seg id=95>Meanwhile , in London , Britain and France are discussing this crisis .</seg>
<seg id=96>International Atomic Energy Agency has warned that if North Korea refuses to abandon its nuclear program , the agency may request the Security Council to take actions .</seg>
<seg id=97>As far as Russia 's and China 's moves are concerned , many US observers think such talks may force Moscow and Beijing to decide whether or not to vote against North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=98>Other countries with nuclear capabilities , such as Iran and Libya , will surely be on close watch for the development of North Korea crisis .</seg>
<seg id=99>They would notice that North Korea withdraws from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty with impunity , or gets huge sums of funds from the United States in exchange that it stop developing nuclear weapons .</seg>
<seg id=100>Einhorn , a former arms control official of the State Department , said : " If North Korea is considered capable of withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , they may figure they can make the same move without paying any cost . "</seg>
<seg id=101>Noland from the Institute for International Economics believes that North Korea may have made a tactical mistake because its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will make the international community more determined than ever to resolve this issue .</seg>

<seg id=103>( AFP , Tokyo , January 15 ) A Japanese court today rejected a 132 million yen ( 1.1 million US dollars ) compensation lawsuit filed by six Chinese who were forced to work as slave laborers in a nickel mine in Japan during World War II .</seg>
<seg id=104>Kyoto District Court Judge Shin Kusumoto said that although what the government and Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co . did in 1944 jointly was illegal , he rejected this lawsuit based on the Civil Law that allows a 20 - year statute of limitations .</seg>
<seg id=105>Kusumoto said : " The defendants ' obligation has expired . "</seg>
<seg id=106>Five former Chinese slave laborers , including the 72 - year - old Liu Zonggen and a family member of a deceased slave laborer , have sought unpaid wages , compensations and apologies from the Japanese government and Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co .</seg>
<seg id=107>The six people worked as slave laborers for Nippon Yakin for a period of one year during which they were often beaten up and poorly fed and clad .</seg>
<seg id=108>Nippon Yakin argued that the company was in no position to oppose the national policy , while the Japanese government , on the other hand , said it has no need to provide compensation to the plaintiffs according to the constitution at that time .</seg>
<seg id=109>Jiji Press reported that after the court announced its ruling , Liu Zonggen said at a press conference : " This is an inhumane ruling . "</seg>
<seg id=110>He said they will file an appeal .</seg>
<seg id=111>Liu Zonggen said : " I 've got the support from many Japanese friends . I 'll fight to the end . "</seg>
<seg id=112>The plaintiffs ' attorney pointed out that this ruling " violates the historical record , " and demanded that the Japanese government and Nippon Yakin pay compensations and offer apologies to resolve the issue .</seg>
<seg id=113>Kyodo News reported that this is the first time such argument has been rejected in lawsuits involving war compensation .</seg>

<seg id=318>Russian Experts : Space Shuttle Disaster May Lead to Temporary Suspension of ISS</seg>
<seg id=319>( AFP , Moscow ) A Russian space expert pointed out that the tragedy of the US space shuttle Columbia 's disintegration on its way back to Earth may lead to the temporary suspension of manned missions on the International Space Station which rely on the US space shuttles and Russian spacecraft .</seg>
<seg id=320>This Russian space expert , who did not wish to be named , told the Russian media Interfax that the accident of Columbia 's disintegration on its re-entry of the earth 's atmosphere will force the astronauts on the ISS to return to Earth and switch the ISS to automatic pilot operation for some period of time .</seg>
<seg id=321>He noted if the age of the space shuttle is confirmed as the cause of the accident , the United States will freeze all space shuttle missions to prevent similar diasters from happening again .</seg>
<seg id=322>He further pointed out it is very likely that the United States will not send astronauts again to the ISS until 2007 or 2008 and must build new spacecraft .</seg>
<seg id=323>If the US space shuttles stop operation , only Russia can send astronauts to the space station by its spacecraft Soyuz . However , as the Russian Space Agency is currently having severe financial problems , the United States and Russia may reach an agreement to use Soyuz to maintain manned missions on the space station while using Progress cargo vessels to send supplies to the ISS .</seg>
<seg id=324>According to the Russian expert , the astronauts currently at the ISS were originally scheduled to take the US space shuttle Atlantis back to Earth on March 1 and should now be expected to continue their stay at the space station .</seg>
<seg id=325>The participants of the ISS program include 16 countries such as the United States , Russia , Japan , Canada and France .</seg>
<seg id=326>The Russian expert pointed out the tragedy on the 1st illustrated the unreliability of the space shuttle . Russia had an accident too in 1971 when a Soyuz - 11 craft crashed while returning to Earth , killing the three astronauts on board .</seg>

<seg id=329>In a televised address , Havel thanked the people for their trust in him , saying : " Without your understanding and goodwill , I would n't have been able to stay in office for a brief moment . "</seg>
<seg id=330>Although suffering from serious health problems , Havel still withstood the great pressure of the top position and stepped down as his term ended even if no successor has yet been chosen .</seg>
<seg id=331>Havel took office on December 29 , 1989 and made his first speech to the public on the balcony of Prague Castle on the very same day . Earlier today he also greeted hundreds of well - wishers on the same spot , saying : " I bid all of you farewell after being your president for 13 years . "</seg>
<seg id=332>The 66 - year - old playwright is a dissident - turned - world-class politician , which itself symbolizes the triumph of democracy over totalitarianism in Europe .</seg>

<seg id=334>Three years later , Czechoslovakia split into two countries , the Czech Republic and Slovakia . Havel continued to be the president of the Czech Republic .</seg>

<seg id=338>( AFP , London , February 3 ) The British government is confident that the French President Chirac will eventually support the UN Security Council 's second resolution authorizing military attacks on Iraq .</seg>
<seg id=339>The British media reported today that Chirac and the British Prime Minister Blair will meet in Le Touquet in northern France tomorrow to exchange views on the latest development on the Iraqi crisis .</seg>
<seg id=340>The headline of the left - wing newspaper The Guardian reads : " Downing Street predicts Chirac will change stance on Iraq . " The Guardian also quoted sources from the office of the British Prime Minister as saying that there are four factors which will influence Chirac into accepting the British way of thinking .</seg>
<seg id=341>The center - right The Times also reported , citing British top officials , that Chirac has realized his anti-war position has " gone too far , " as he was taken by surprise that seven European countries sided with Britain and signed a pro-US letter on the issue of Iraq published by the international media last week .</seg>
<seg id=342>Quoting a British diplomat , the Times reported that Chirac likes to be in the spotlight and to be coaxed with sweet words , but he is far from dumb . It may be too much to expect Chirac to make a 180 degree change tomorrow , but it is still hoped that the summit meeting between the two countries may see signs of Chirac 's attitude change .</seg>

<seg id=344>( AFP , Seoul , February 3 ) The US military claimed that the transfer of some 2,900 US officers and soldiers scheduled to leave South Korea in the coming three months has been frozen so that the stationed troops can maintain readiness for war .</seg>
<seg id=345>The freeze on this military order of transfer has no direct links with the nuclear crisis in North Korea , but it illustrated the inadequacy of the United States in tackling both Iraq and North Korea .</seg>

<seg id=350>( AFP , Houston ) NASA said that suspected debris from the disintegrated space shuttle Columbia have also been spotted in the states of California and Arizona in western United States , which may provide important clues to why the space shuttle broke up in the air .</seg>
<seg id=351>NASA 's Associate Administrator Kostelnik said : " We have received quite a few reports that debris have been found in California and Arizona . "</seg>
<seg id=352>He said a team of experts has been dispatched to various locations in those states to examine the debris yet pointed out cautiously that so far it is not clear what those pieces are .</seg>
<seg id=353>Dittemore , the space shuttle program manager , said on the 3rd that NASA has formed a special team to search for debris in areas west of Texas and Louisiana where most of the space shuttle Columbia 's wreckage has been found .</seg>
<seg id=354>Dittemore pointed out such debris can be crucial because it may provide the critical missing part about the cause of the accident .</seg>
<seg id=355>The space shuttle Columbia was preparing to land at Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 9:16 a.m. ( 10:16 p.m. Taipei time ) on the 1st when it broke up in the air into pieces of burning wreckage . The seven astronauts on board the space shuttle were all killed .</seg>
<seg id=356>Investigators are trying to understand why there was a sharp rise of temperature to as high as 16 degrees Celsius on the left side of the space shuttle minutes before the communication broke off while about simultaneously an unusual drag resistance occurred on the left side of the space shuttle , causing the space shuttle to lose control .</seg>
<seg id=357>Kostelnik indicated that the possibility of finding debris in locations farther west than originally expected can be crucial in determining the cause of the accident .</seg>
<seg id=358>He said : " It 's of critical importance to examine the debris in the early stage of the accident . "</seg>

<seg id=364>In the meantime , Lugar , the Republican senior senator on foreign affairs , also urgently called for the United States to engage in dialogs with North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=365>Lugar said : " In my opinion , the US officials should have talks with North Korean officials to discuss how to end North Korea 's nuclear weapons program through an agreement to a complete international inspection . "</seg>
<seg id=366>Powell 's deputy Armitage told Lugar 's Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the US talks with North Korean officials are just a matter of time , not whether to have or not have talks .</seg>
<seg id=367>Armitage said : " Of course we 'll have direct talks with North Korea ; there 's no question about that . "</seg>

<seg id=371>In addition , the threat of a possible war in Iraq further dimmed the economic outlook in Germany , the biggest economy in the euro - zone .</seg>

<seg id=374>Last December , the total number of the jobless people reached 4.225 million at an unemployment rate of 10.1%.</seg>
<seg id=375>The unemployment in winter months in Germany usually increases for seasonal reasons as most of companies , especially those in the construction industry , lay off employees due to bad weather .</seg>
<seg id=376>However , even after taking this reason into account , the lines for unemployment benefits application last month still continued to grow longer .</seg>

<seg id=385>ERC also recommends that the government defer the restoration of the Central Provident Fund contribution rate for employers and consider no raise of the CPF contribution rate for two years to avoid burdening employers during the current difficult time and to help reduce unemployment rate and send a strong message to foreign investors .</seg>

<seg id=415>Countries such as France , Russia and China still propose tougher arms inspection for Iraq instead of a US - led war against Iraq .</seg>
<seg id=416>Fleischer noted that President Bush also considers military actions as the " last resort . "</seg>
<seg id=417>However , he insisted on the timetable Bush has set , saying that the United Nations has got only " a few weeks not months " to test peaceful disarmament with Iraq , which will then be followed by military actions .</seg>
<seg id=418>New York Times : White House Studies Sanctions against North Korea</seg>
<seg id=419>( AFP , Washington ) Citing US officials , the New York Times today reported that White House is studying sanctions against North Korea once Pyongyang fails to abandon its development of nuclear weapons .</seg>
<seg id=420>The report pointed out that these sanctions will include interdicting North Korea 's arms shipment and cutting off the channels through which North Koreans in Japan send money to North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=421>The report pointed out that the Pentagon and the State Department are working on the detailed plans for sanctions so that the United States can respond promptly any time when North Korea takes its new steps to pursue the development of nuclear weapons .</seg>
<seg id=422>According to the New York Times report , the first step will be to urge the UN Security Council , perhaps in the next two weeks , to denounce North Korea 's recent measures to develop nuclear weapons such as withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and reactivating its frozen nuclear facility at Yongbyon that is capable of producing weapons - grade plutonium .</seg>
<seg id=423>Yet , the Pacific allies of Washington authorities are still opposed to the idea of sanctioning against North Korea , while the UN Security Council may still focus on the issue of Iraq for the next few weeks .</seg>
<seg id=424>In the meantime , the New York Times report pointed out , many US officials are concerned if the United States launches attacks against Iraq , North Korea may use the opportunity to promote its weapons production .</seg>

<seg id=426>( AFP , Manila , Philippines , February 17 ) The US military trainers will be sent to the hostage island of Jolo in the Philippines this year to assist the country in coping with the terrorist threat from the rebel Islamic groups .</seg>

<seg id=429>Philippine Defense Secretary Reyes told media reporters that the US Major General Weber will arrive in the Philippines soon to " discuss all kinds of conditions and details regarding the operation in Sulu . "</seg>
<seg id=430>Sulu , the archipelago in the southern Philippines , includes the island of Jolo .</seg>
<seg id=431>Golez , Arroyo 's national security advisor , said that the military exercise in Sulu will " give the Philippine armed forces the maximum training in counter - terrorism . "</seg>
<seg id=432>Since the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001 , the US government has been increasing its military assistance to the Philippine government , concerned that the al Qaeda Islamic militants driven out by the US - led military actions in Afghanistan may have established their base in Southeast Asia .</seg>
<seg id=433>The above concern has been fully confirmed by the bombing incident in the resort island of Bali in Indonesia last year , which killed nearly 200 people .</seg>

<seg id=441>MobilCom said in a statement later today that Schmid 's personal bankruptcy has no effect on the company 's operation or contract .</seg>
<seg id=442>The statement added that there will be no change on the rescue plan of about 7 billion euros undertaken by France Telecom . According to this rescue plan , the German government and financial institutions will provide about 100 million euros of financing to MobilCom , which currently employs about 5,000 people .</seg>
<seg id=443>US - South Korean Military Exercise to be Held in March ; North Korea Threatens to Quit Armistice Agreement</seg>
<seg id=444>( AFP , Seoul , February 18 ) South Korea and the United States are going to conduct a large - scale military exercise starting from early March , that will last nearly a month . North Korea , in response , threatens to quit the Armistice Agreement that ended the Korean war .</seg>
<seg id=445>At a time when the tensions caused by the nuclear stand - off on the Korean Peninsula have continued for four months and showed no sign of easing off , North Korea 's threat to quit the Armistice Agreement can be generally interpreted as Pyongyang authorities ' response to the announcement made by the United States and South Korea yesterday of the joint military exercise to be held in March .</seg>
<seg id=446>The statement issued by the North Korean military accuses the United States of repeatedly violating the Armistice Agreement : " If the US side continues violating and misusing the Armistice Agreement as it pleases , there will be no need for North Korea to remain bound to the Armistice Agreement uncomfortably .</seg>
<seg id=447>The future development will depend entirely on the US attitude . "</seg>
<seg id=448>However , the US top military officials said that North Korea had said they would no longer be bound to the Armistice Agreement as early as in 1994 .</seg>
<seg id=449>US authorities announced yesterday that the United States and South Korea will hold their annual joint military exercise on the Korean Peninsula from March 4 to April 2 .</seg>
<seg id=450>A South Korean government official said that South Korea issued an invitation to North Korea yesterday , asking them to send observers to watch this military exercise .</seg>
<seg id=451>The official , who did not want to be named , said : " North Korea 's statement to quit the Armistice Agreement is obviously a response to the upcoming joint military exercise by the United States and South Korea . "</seg>
<seg id=452>Earlier , the United States ordered 12 B - 52 bombers and the same number of B - 1 bombers to get ready to go to areas around the Korean Peninsula . North Korea strongly denounced this move .</seg>
<seg id=453>In addition , the Japanese media reported yesterday that the United States has planned to step up its military deployment in Northeast Asia in order to guard against the concerns triggered by North Korea 's nuclear weapons program .</seg>
<seg id=454>Indonesian Authorities Reject Proposal to Increase Security Protection of US Embassy</seg>
<seg id=455>( AFP , Jakarta , February 19 ) The US embassy in Jakarta proposed to Indonesian authorities that a 3 - meter - high surrounding wall be built to increase the security of the embassy , but the proposal was rejected .</seg>
<seg id=456>" The Jakarta Post " and the state - owned " Antala " News Agency both reported today that Jakarta authorities rejected this proposal to build a wall to replace the fence that now separates the embassy and the residences from the outside on grounds that it is aesthetically unacceptable .</seg>
<seg id=457>Jakarta officials , quoting Mayor Sutiyoso , pointed out that the wall can be built , provided that it be built five meters away from the existing fence inside the embassy compound .</seg>
<seg id=458>In addition , the embassy must put sod and plant flowers in between the two fences to improve the look of the embassy compound .</seg>
<seg id=459>Sutiyoso indicated that landscaping can reduce the feeling of the US embassy as a citadel .</seg>
<seg id=460>Since around the time the United States led the military actions in Afghanistan aimed to overthrow the Taliban regime in 2001 , its embassy in Indonesia has been endlessly confronted with protesting activities .</seg>
<seg id=461>That year , when the former ambassador protested against the Jakarta police for failing to effectively stop the threat from the hardline Islamic groups on the safety of the Americans , the relevant authorities increased the security protection of the embassy .</seg>
<seg id=462>It is generally expected that large - scale protests will become inevitable if the United States launches military actions against Iraq .</seg>

<seg id=466>The broadband connection unit , which consists of a hard drive and an adapter , is currently available for purchase only through Internet service providers .</seg>

<seg id=475>( AFP , Singapore , February 24 ) A report released by International Data Corp . today pointed out that in the coming two years , there will be more computer programmers and other professional developers in the Asia - Pacific Region than in North America .</seg>
<seg id=476>In 2001 , North America had the largest concentration of professional developers , while the Asia - Pacific Region replaced Europe to become the area with the second largest number of professional developers .</seg>
<seg id=477>However , the IDC report said that the strong growth in China and India is expected to push the Asia - Pacific Region to the top by 2005 .</seg>
<seg id=478>Asian regions , especially India , are the main source of IT professionals in North America .</seg>

<seg id=480>IDC said that there were 7.8 million professional developers in 2001 , and the number is expected to grow to 13.3 million by 2006 .</seg>
<seg id=481>The report pointed out that by the end of 2001 , there were 1.7 million professional developers in Asia .</seg>
<seg id=482>IDC noted that the drop in the number of IT professionals in North America is partly due to the decline of technology sector in the region .</seg>
<seg id=483>Study Shows Father 's Genes May Affect Timing of Birth</seg>
<seg id=484>( AFP , Paris , February 28 ) According to a report of a Danish study to be published on Saturday 's " British Medical Journal , " a father 's genes may affect the timing of a child 's birth .</seg>
<seg id=485>About 5% of pregnant women go past their term , with a gestational length of 294 days .</seg>
<seg id=486>At present , this problem is known to have effects on the health of both mother and child , but what causes it remains a mystery .</seg>
<seg id=487>The Danish researchers tracked 43,000 cases of birth from 1980 to 1992 . The targeted women have at least two children and had a post-term pregnancy for the first delivery .</seg>
<seg id=488>Only the data of their first two deliveries are used for analysis .</seg>
<seg id=489>Overall , of those women who had a prolonged pregnancy for the first delivery , nearly 20% had the same experience for their second pregnancy .</seg>
<seg id=490>However , when the first and the second child had different fathers , the rate dropped to just a little bit over 15%.</seg>
<seg id=491>Olesen , the lead author of the research report , told AFP : " This is already a lot .</seg>
<seg id=492>This means if you ( with the second child ) have the same partner , then compared with those who change their partners , your chance of having a prolonged pregnancy will be over 30%. "</seg>
<seg id=493>The research report said : " If a woman changes her partner every time she gets pregnant , it may reduce the risk of reoccurrence of post-term delivery .</seg>
<seg id=494>We believe this is a new finding .</seg>
<seg id=495>But the result means the timing of birth may be decided by a father 's genes . "</seg>

<seg id=541>US Defense Department Calls off 2 Missile Intercept Tests</seg>
<seg id=542>Xinhua News Agency , Washington , January 8 ( Reporter Tan Xinmu ) Lehner , spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency at the Pentagon , announced on the 8th that the US military authorities have decided to call off the two missile intercept tests scheduled for the first half of this year because the development of a new type of booster that launches the interceptor is behind the original schedule .</seg>
<seg id=543>Lehner told the media here that the Missile Defense Agency this year will need to concentrate on solving the problem of the booster and that the next missile intercept test will be conducted after Boeing manufactures the new type of booster this fall .</seg>
<seg id=544>Boeing originally planned to begin flight tests in 2000 on the new booster that carries the missile " interceptor , " but the tests were postponed due to technical reasons .</seg>

<seg id=546>In the previous eight ground - based missile intercept tests , the US military used a modified " Minuteman " rocket as a surrogate booster , but the results of the tests on this kind of booster were not satisfactory .</seg>
<seg id=547>The missile intercept tests conducted in July 2000 and last December were not successful because the " interceptor " failed to separate from the booster .</seg>

<seg id=707>Spending on durables rose 6.1%, while spending on non-durables and services only increased 0.2%.</seg>

This is the quarter with the smallest growth since the first quarter of 1993 .</seg>
<seg id=710>Economic analysts think uncertain factors such as a possible US war on Iraq , the sharp decline in the stock market and a stagnant job market have mainly held back consumers from spending and consequently led to a sharp slowdown in the US economy in the fourth quarter .</seg>

<seg id=726>Garneau , Canada 's first astronaut and president of the Canadian Space Agency , said that the US investigation of the Columbia accident may hinder the planned missions of the International Space Station ; some of the programs may have to be postponed or even canceled .</seg>
<seg id=727>The Canadian astronauts , MacLean and Williams , were originally scheduled to take their space flights respectively in May and November this year .</seg>
<seg id=728>The two people are currently receiving training in Houston , USA .</seg>
<seg id=729>During the 1990s , three Canadian astronauts participated in space missions on the space shuttle Columbia .</seg>

<seg id=735>Xinhua News Agency , Washington , February 3 ( Reporter He Ying ) The US Department of Commerce issued a report on the 3rd , stating that the construction spending in the United States last December rose 1.2% over November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 858.3 billion US dollars .</seg>
<seg id=736>The report said spending on residential construction last December reached 434.6 billion US dollars on an annualized basis after a seasonal adjustment , up 2.9% over November .</seg>
<seg id=737>Analysts think that the low interest rate is a key factor for the robust growth in residential construction .</seg>
<seg id=738>Currently , the US Federal Reserve still keeps the short - term interest rate at 1.2%, the lowest level in 41 years .</seg>
<seg id=739>However , in contrast with the residential construction , the commercial construction spending in the United States last December was 158.6 billion US dollars on an annualized basis after a seasonal adjustment , down 1.9% from November .</seg>

<seg id=844>Xinhua News Agency , Vienna , February 20 ( Reporter Lin Chuan ) Researchers at Vienna University in Austria found in human spinal marrow a group of neurological cells that have long lasting memory and will become highly agitated the moment they are slightly stimulated by pain . This is another step forward in finding the cause of chronic pain .</seg>
<seg id=845>Chronic pain sufferers are hypersensitive to pain and eventually have to live with pain in their daily life .</seg>
<seg id=846>However , what causes the disorder has so far remained virtually unknown .</seg>
<seg id=847>According to the report by Austrian News Agency , the research team led by Jrgen Sandkhler , head of neurophysiology department at the Brain Research Institute , Vienna University , found while doing a biopsy on tissue slices that some spinal marrow cells exhibiting no unusual behavior under normal condition show agitation when stimulated by pain .</seg>

<seg id=1>Scientists Decrypted the Sequence of a Chromosome Crucial to Symptoms of Early Disorders</seg>
<seg id=2>( Agence France - Presse , Paris , 2nd ) - An international consortium of scientists said that they have decrypted the sequence of the fourteenth pair of human chromosome , which is linked to a broad range of diseases , including an early onset of Alzheimer that can strike people in their 30s .</seg>
<seg id=3>This is the fourth chromosome to be fully sequenced up till now and it comprises of over 87 million pairs of Deoxyribonucleic Acid ( DNA ) .</seg>
<seg id=4>The research , which was published in the weekly British science journal Nature , said the sequence of Chromosome 14 is made up by 1,050 genes and gene fragments .</seg>
<seg id=5>The goal of gene scientists is to provide diagnostic tools to identify flawed genes that cause illness , and ultimately to provide treatments , which can stop these genes from malfunctioning .</seg>
<seg id=6>The international consortium of scientists led by French gene research center Genoscope said Chromosome 14 has two clusters of genes , which are vital for the immune system , as well as more than 60 disease genes .</seg>
<seg id=7>Chromosome 14 has been identified in a wide range of diseases during previous studies , which include a form of spastic paraplegia that strikes young children ; missing teeth ; several kinds of vision and hearing impairments ; and early onset of Alzheimer disease .</seg>

<seg id=12>( Agence France - Presse , Manila , 2nd ) - Australia reopened its embassy in the Philippines today . The embassy was closed seven weeks ago after what was described as a specific threat of a terrorist attack .</seg>
<seg id=13>Philippine foreign department said in a statement that Australian Ambassador to Manila Ruth Pearce phoned Philippine Foreign Secretary Blas Ople to announce the resumption of full operations of the embassy .</seg>
<seg id=14>Canada and the European Union , which both shut down their embassies like Australia on November 28 , have reopened their embassies earlier this week .</seg>
<seg id=15>Ople said all three ambassadors expressed satisfaction with the enhanced security measures adopted by the Philippine government .</seg>
<seg id=16>The closure of the embassies had angered the Philippine government , which said that the alleged threats were exaggerated and the closure of embassies harmed the image of Philippines .</seg>
<seg id=17>Manila had once relieved the duty of a police intelligence official because he leaked unverified intelligence about terrorist threats on Australian and Canadian embassies .</seg>
<seg id=18>The European Union office is in the same building as the Australian embassy .</seg>

<seg id=20>Australian Foreign Minister : North Korea 's Bad Behavior Could Not Win More Aid</seg>
<seg id=21>( Agence France - Presse , Sydney , 2nd ) - Australia called for a concerted international effort to convince North Korea that it cannot win more aid or other concessions by defying the nuclear non-proliferation agreement or through other " bad behavior " .</seg>
<seg id=22>Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said today that Pyongyang 's decision to restart a controversial nuclear facility and expel United Nations inspectors was obviously aimed at forcing international community to make concessions in aid and trade .</seg>
<seg id=23>Australia is one of the several countries that have diplomatic relations with North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=24>" We believe what North Korea wants to do is to violate the agreed framework put into place in 1994 , such as to obtain concessions , aid and trade etc. from other countries in the world , including the United States , " Downer said .</seg>
<seg id=25>" We want to raise a point to North Korea and it is a very important point . Bad behavior is not going to be rewarded , " Downer said during an interview by Australia Broadcasting Corporation .</seg>
<seg id=26>" The kind of behavior , like expelling United Nations inspectors and reactivating the Yongbyon nuclear facility , will only cause the international community to hold back their supports , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=27>" It is going to create an opposite effect . We hope that diplomatic measures are going to be effective . "</seg>
<seg id=28>" On the other hand , if we are to overreact , we will fall into North Korea 's trap .</seg>
<seg id=29>We do not want to do that . "</seg>
<seg id=30>Downer said Australia is working closely with the United States and other key allies to force North Korea to revoke its recent steps for restarting a previously frozen nuclear program .</seg>

<seg id=32>Bush Defends His Economic Stimulus Plan</seg>
<seg id=33>( Agence France - Presse , Washington , 6th ) - U.S. President George W . Bush vowed that his upcoming economic stimulus plan would benefit the " working class " and not just the wealthy . People generally believe the wealthy ones will benefit most from Bush 's plan , which pushes for a substantial cut in taxes .</seg>
<seg id=34>Bush told reporters in anticipation of the formal unveiling of his plan in Chicago , " Tomorrow , ladies and gentlemen , you will hear me say : the U.S. economy is one of the strongest economies in the world .</seg>
<seg id=35>However , we believe the U.S. economy can be stronger than what it is now . "</seg>
<seg id=36>It is expected that President Bush is to unveil a 10 - year , US $600 billion economic stimulus plan . About half of the amount will be used to absorb the effect on elimination of dividend taxes payable by shareholders . The plan also calls for accelerated implementation of the tax - rate cuts approved by members of U.S. Congress in 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=37>Whether the plan can go through smoothly is generally viewed as a foretaste of the battle in the 2004 U.S. presidential election . Democrats accused that President Bush 's blueprint will only give the rich additional splendor and is unlike the Democrat 's proposed plan , which tries to send the poor charcoals during a snowy weather .</seg>
<seg id=38>The eight - point Democratic proposal revolved around a US $136 billion incentive package to stimulate consumer spending . Over 10 years , the Democratic plan would cost US $100 billion .</seg>
<seg id=39>" This is a fair , fast - acting and fiscally sound plan , " said Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives , during a joint press conference with other opposition congress members .</seg>
<seg id=40>Bush led the White House to retort outsiders ' allegations that the plan only benefits the rich . Bush said the economic stimulus plan , that he is going to unveil , focuses on " stimulating economic vitality and growth " .</seg>
<seg id=41>Bush said , " This plan will provide tax cuts and concessions to the working class .</seg>
<seg id=42>The plan recognizes that people can only spend money when they have more money to spare . It is only then will more jobs be created . "</seg>

<seg id=45>U.S. President Bush 's administration is facing twin crises over Iraq and North Korea . After talks with senior Japanese and South Korean diplomats , officials of Bush administration issued a statement , which said United States was taking a " step forward " in its policy towards Pyongyang .</seg>
<seg id=46>" The U.S. delegation explained that the United States is willing to talk to North Korea about how it can meet its obligations to the international community , " the statement said .</seg>
<seg id=47>" However , the U.S. delegation stressed that the United States will not provide any rewards to North Korea for its fulfillment of existing obligations . "</seg>
<seg id=48>In a carefully worded language full of diplomatic terms , U.S. officials insisted that they were willing to talk to North Korea . However , they would not contemplate a negotiating process until Pyongyang complied with the various agreements prohibiting the production of nuclear weapons .</seg>
<seg id=49>" We are not willing to pay again for the same agreements that have been reached before , " said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher .</seg>

<seg id=55>Wilner said the maximum penalty for securities fraud is 10 years imprisonment . However , the sentence is expected to be " significantly shorter " under the plea deal .</seg>
<seg id=56>Prosecutors and investigators said that Kalina took part in a financial fraud scheme in which Homestore executives misled investors by inflating revenues in the financial reports of 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=57>Fuchs said Kalina knew the price of the stock was artificially inflated and he sold his own stock in Homestore for profits when " Wall Street was not aware that a key portion of Homestore 's revenue was falsified " .</seg>
<seg id=58>John DeSimone , a former vice president of Homestore , has pleaded guilty to a similar insider trading charge . The court is expected to hand out a sentence on April 21 .</seg>
<seg id=59>Homestore 's chief operating officer John Giesecke and ex-chief financial officer Joseph Shew have also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud .</seg>

<seg id=79>Chairman of AOL Time Warner to Resign in May</seg>
<seg id=80>( Agence France - Presse , Washington , 12th ) - Steve Case , Chairman of AOL Time Warner Inc ., announced tonight that he will resign in May . He said that his move is " in the best interest of the company " .</seg>
<seg id=81>In an explanation of the decision , Case said he decided to adopt steps to avoid the criticisms of shareholders " from hindering our ability to cooperate as a team and focus fully on our businesses " .</seg>
<seg id=82>Upon approval by U.S. Federal Trade Commission , Case oversaw America Online 's merger with Time Warner in January 2001 . The intention was that he would remain as a director in the board of AOL Time Warner .</seg>
<seg id=83>The merger had a value of US $155 billion when it was announced in January 2000 . Later in that year , European policy makers approved the merger .</seg>

I have hoped that I can serve as Chairman for this large company in the next few years as I was the architect of the merger . I have felt it was important that I stay as Chairman and help get things on track . "</seg>
<seg id=85>Case stressed , " First , this company does not need distractions at this critical time .

<seg id=89>North Korea Withdrew from Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and Becomes a Foe of the World</seg>
<seg id=90>( Agence France - Presse , Washington , 15th ) - The showdown between United States and North Korea has elevated from a side issue of " axis of evil " to an international crisis . It appears that the global efforts for nuclear non-proliferation in the past several decades are likely to fall short of success for lack of a final effort .</seg>
<seg id=91>Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty on the 10th of this month and is poised to confront with Washington .</seg>
<seg id=92>Analysts said the global endeavor and attempt to curb nuclear proliferation have the fear of a failure . The treaty was already seriously damaged when non-treaty countries , Pakistan and India , joined the nuclear club in 1998 .</seg>
<seg id=93>Four days after Pyongyang adopted the aforesaid action , the five permanent members of United Nations Security Council have all taken preemptive diplomatic actions for the crisis .</seg>
<seg id=94>Russia said it would send a special envoy to Pyongyang with a proposal to end the stalemate . On the other hand , China suggested to host dialogues for a possible compromise between United States and North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=95>Britain and France discussed the crisis in London .</seg>
<seg id=96>International Atomic Energy Agency warned that it might demand actions by the Security Council if Pyongyang refuses to abandon its nuclear plan .</seg>
<seg id=97>As to the actions of Russia and China , many U.S. observers believed this kind of talks might force Moscow and Beijing to decide whether to cast a veto vote for North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=98>Other countries that might have nuclear capability , for example , Iran and Libya , are certainly monitoring closely the development of the North Korea crisis .</seg>
<seg id=99>They would be interested to know whether North Korea can withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty without any penalty , or would United States offer huge sums to North Korea in exchange for a cessation in nuclear weapon development .</seg>
<seg id=100>" If North Korea is considered to have the ability to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , then these countries may contemplate that they could also adopt the same action without paying any price , " said Robert Einhorn , former assistant secretary of state for weapon non-proliferation .</seg>
<seg id=101>Marcus Noland of the Institute for International Economics believed that North Korea might have committed a tactical mistake . It is because the decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty may strengthen the determination of the international community to solve this problem .</seg>
<seg id=102>Japanese Court Rejected Compensation Claims by Former Chinese Slave Laborers</seg>

Six Chinese people brought up the suits because they were forced into slave labor in a nickel mine in Japan during World War II .</seg>
<seg id=104>Kyoto District Court judge Shin Kusumoto said the government and Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co., Ltd. had both acted illegally in 1944 . However , he rejected the demand for compensation because there is a 20 - year statute of limitation for compensation claims under civil law .</seg>
<seg id=105>" The defendants ' obligations had exhausted , " Kusumoto said .</seg>
<seg id=106>Five former slave laborers , including Liu Zonggen , 72 , and the family of a deceased man , were demanding unpaid wages , compensation and an apology from the Japanese government and Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co., Ltd.</seg>
<seg id=107>The six men had worked as slave laborers in Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co., Ltd. for one year . During that period , they were often beaten ; not given enough food ; and not enough clothing to keep warm .</seg>
<seg id=108>Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co., Ltd. argued that the Company had no power to resist policies implemented by the State . The Japanese government said that it had no obligation to compensate the plaintiffs under the Constitution back then .</seg>
<seg id=109>Jiji News reported that in a press conference after the court announced the decision , Liu Zonggen said , " The ruling is lack of humanity " .</seg>
<seg id=110>He said that the plaintiffs would appeal .</seg>
<seg id=111>" I have received a lot of support from friends in Japan and I will fight to the end , " Liu Zonggen said .</seg>
<seg id=112>The plaintiffs ' lawyers said the ruling is an " unprecedented in history " . They demand the Japanese government and Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co., Ltd. to pay the compensation and make an apology to solve the problem .</seg>
<seg id=113>According to Kyodo News , it is the first occasion that this kind of defenses were rejected by court in lawsuits for War related compensations .</seg>
<seg id=114>In 1944 , the Japanese army arrested about two hundred Chinese people and brought them to a nickel mine in Kaya , Kyoto Prefecture to work as slave labor .</seg>

<seg id=318>Russian Expert : Space Shuttle Disaster Might Lead to Temporary Suspension of Operations in the Space Station</seg>
<seg id=319>( Agence France - Presse , Moscow ) - A Russian space expert said the unfortunate event of the disintegration of U.S. Space Shuttle Columbia during its re-entry to earth could lead to the temporary suspension of manned missions in the International Space Station ( ISS ) , because the station depends on U.S. shuttles and Russian space craft .</seg>
<seg id=320>The Russian space expert , who declined to be named , told Russian Interfax news agency the disintegration accident of the Columbia as it re-entered the earth 's atmosphere could force astronauts on board the space station to return to earth ; switch on the station 's automatic systems and let it run on itself for a period of time .</seg>
<seg id=321>He said if it is determined that the cause of the accident was the age of the space shuttle , U.S. will freeze shuttle flights in order to avoid another catastrophe .</seg>
<seg id=322>He further pointed out that means U.S. must build new spacecraft and it will take until 2007-2008 before U.S. can send astronauts again to the space station .</seg>
<seg id=323>If space shuttles are grounded , then Russia is the only country that could send astronauts to the space station using its Soyuz spacecraft . However , the Russian space agency is currently facing severe financing problems . Hence , United States and Russia may reach an agreement to use Soyuz spacecraft to keep the space station manned . The Progress spacecraft can be used to carry cargos and keep the space station supplied .</seg>
<seg id=324>The Russian expert believed the current crew on board the ISS were due to return to earth on board the U.S. Space Shuttle Atlantis on March 1 but now , they might have to extend their stay in the station .</seg>
<seg id=325>Sixteen countries participate in the ISS project , including the United States , Russia , Japan , Canada and France .</seg>
<seg id=326>The Russian expert also pointed out the accident on the 1st revealed the unreliability of the shuttles . Russia also had an accident in 1971 and it lost three astronauts on board the Soyuz - 11 spacecraft during a re-entry to earth .</seg>

<seg id=344>( Agence France - Presse , Seoul , 3rd ) - U.S. military said orders have been issued to freeze the scheduled transfer of about 2,900 U.S. army officers and soldiers out of South Korea in the next three months such that the resident army can maintain combat readiness .</seg>
<seg id=345>The freeze order is not directly linked to the North Korea nuclear crisis but it does highlight the difficult position of the United States having to cope with problems from Iraq and North Korea at the same time .</seg>
<seg id=346>The U.S. 8th Army in Seoul said today that they have received rotation freeze orders such as to maintain troop levels in South Korea . Meanwhile , replacement plan for units based in U.S. were also suspended because of military deployments near Iraq and in Afghanistan .</seg>
<seg id=347>U.S. 8th Army commander Lieutenant General Charles Campbell said in a statement that the freeze - transfer order would ensure U.S. military strength in South Korea .</seg>
<seg id=348>U.S. has about 37,000 soldiers in South Korea pursuant to the U.S. - South Korea joint defense treaty . U.S. soldiers in South Korea have been on alert since December last year when North Korea 's nuclear development ambition came to light .</seg>
<seg id=349>Debris Found in Western U.S. of California and Arizona That Could Be Remains of the Space Shuttle</seg>
<seg id=350>( Agence France - Presse , Houston ) - U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) said debris have been found in the western United States of California and Arizona , which could be the remains of space shuttle Columbia , and these debris might provide crucial clues to the space shuttle 's disintegration in the air .</seg>
<seg id=351>" We have received quite a number of reports from California and Arizona about debris found , " NASA Deputy Associate Administrator Michael Kostelnik said .</seg>
<seg id=352>He said an expert team has been ordered to go to different spots in these states to examine the debris . However , he also cautioned that it is not clear at this moment what the debris are .</seg>
<seg id=353>Shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore said on the 3rd that NASA has already set up a special team , which is responsible to search areas west of Texas and Louisiana , where the bulk of debris from space shuttle Columbia were found .</seg>
<seg id=354>Dittemore pointed out the debris could be crucial because they might provide the vital missing link to the cause of the disaster .</seg>
<seg id=355>Space shuttle Columbia prepared to descend at 9:16 a.m. ( Taipei time 10:16 p.m. ) on the 1st for landing in Florida before the Kennedy Space Center but it disintegrated into many burning pieces in the air . All of the seven astronauts on board the space shuttle died in the line of duty .</seg>
<seg id=356>Investigators are trying to understand why the left side of the shuttle showed a sharp temperature spike of 16 degrees just a few minutes before communication was cut off . At about the same time , there was an unusual drag on the left side of the space shuttle , which caused it to lose control .</seg>
<seg id=357>Kostelnik said the possibility of finding debris at spots west of the expected areas is viewed as crucial for finding the cause of the accident .</seg>
<seg id=358>" Inspection of debris from the early stage of the accident is most crucial , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=359>South Korea Envoy Urged Dialogue Between U.S. and North Korea</seg>
<seg id=360>( Agence France - Presse , Washington , 4th ) - U.S. President Bush is facing strong demands from South Korea 's next government and key congressional allies for direct talks between Washington and North Korea before the nuclear crisis becomes out of control .</seg>
<seg id=361>One day after Bush ordered heavy bombers on alert for deployment , an act that provoked North Korea , his senior aides were forced to defend Washington 's policy towards North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=362>Chyung Dai - Chul ( transliteration ) , an envoy for South Korea 's incoming president Roh Moo - Hyun , held talks with Secretary of State Colin Powell . Chyung stressed South Korea 's stance , " We hope that the United States will take a more active role in dialogue with North Korea . "</seg>
<seg id=363>He further said that dialogue should be conducted in an international setting with a multilateral approach .</seg>
<seg id=364>Meanwhile , Republican senior foreign policy senator Richard Lugar also called for dialogue between U.S. and North Korea .</seg>
<seg id=365>" I personally believe that United States officials should talk to North Korean officials and discuss how to end the North Korean nuclear weapons programs through an agreement on comprehensive international inspection , " Lugar said .</seg>
<seg id=366>Powell 's deputy , Richard Armitage told Lugar 's Senate Foreign Relations Committee that it is a question of when , and not whether U.S. and North Korean officials will talk .</seg>
<seg id=367>" Of course we are going to have direct talks with North Korean -- there is no question about that , " said Armitage .</seg>
<seg id=368>However , he said that the dialogue would only take place when Washington was confident that it had built up a " strong international public opinion " backing the termination of Pyongyang 's nuclear program .</seg>
<seg id=369>January Unemployment Surged to Five - Year High in Germany</seg>
<seg id=370>( Agence France - Presse , Frankfurt , 5th ) - According to official data , the bad winter weather and the prolonged weakness in the economy have pushed up German unemployment rate in January to a five - year high . This is another heavy blow to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder , who is just over 100 days into his second term .</seg>
<seg id=371>Furthermore , the threat of a possible war in Iraq has deepened the economic gloom in euro zone 's biggest economy .</seg>
<seg id=372>A freeze in the German labor market is likely to continue in coming months .</seg>
<seg id=373>According to data published by German Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg , the number of people looking for a job in Germany surged to 4.623 million -- or 11.1 percent of the working population in Germany . The January unemployment rate is the highest since March 1998 and is the highest January level in five years .</seg>
<seg id=374>In December last year , the number of unemployed was 4.225 million , which was equivalent to an unemployment rate of 10.1 percent .</seg>
<seg id=375>Due to seasonal factors , unemployment usually increases in winter months in Germany , as companies , particularly the construction industry , lay off employees because of the bad weather .</seg>
<seg id=376>However , even after taking such factors into account , the queue applying for unemployment benefits continued to lengthen in last month .</seg>
<seg id=377>Seasonally adjusted data published separately by the Bundesbank in Frankfurt showed that the number of unemployed surged to 4.274 million in January from the 4.212 million in December last year .</seg>
<seg id=378>Meanwhile , the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 10.3 percent from 10.1 percent .</seg>
<seg id=379>Federal Labor Office chief Florian Gerster attributed the sharp rise in number of job seekers to both the usual winter weather and the poor state of the economy .</seg>

<seg id=381>( Agence France - Presse , Singapore , 6th ) - Singapore Economic Review Committee ( ERC ) said Singapore has to wait till 2004 for a full economic recovery due to global geopolitical and economic uncertainties .</seg>
<seg id=382>" The Singapore economy has not fully recovered from the 2001 recession . There are too many uncertainties in the region . The economies in U.S. , Europe and Japan are slow . The prospect of a war in Iraq and the significant challenges from China have all cast a shadow over Singapore 's short term economy , " ERC said in its annual economic review report .</seg>
<seg id=383>However , there is still a reasonable chance of a growth in the Singaporean economy this year but one must wait until 2004 for a full recovery .</seg>
<seg id=384>The Singapore government has forecasted an economic growth between two and five percent this year after the economy expanded 2.2 percent last year . However , that is still far lower than the annual average growth of 7.3 percent that Singapore has experienced since 1985 .</seg>
<seg id=385>ERC recommended the government to defer the restoration of cuts in employers ' contribution rate to the employment pension fund . Any increase in the rate of pension fund contribution is to be considered again two years later . The idea is not to overburden employers in a difficult period of time ; help reduce the unemployment rate and pass on a strong message to foreign investors .</seg>

<seg id=414>When Fleischer was asked about the timing for Washington to propose a resolution aimed at enforcing resolution 1441 , he said it was " too soon to say " but Washington would consult its allies on the language to be used in its content .</seg>

North Korea 's response is a threat to pull out from the armistice agreement , which ended the Korean War .</seg>
<seg id=445>As the tensions in the nuclear stalemate over the past four months has no sign of any alleviation , the general interpretation for North Korea 's threatened pull out from the armistice agreement is that Pyongyang tries to make a response to the March joint military maneuver between U.S. and South Korea announced yesterday .</seg>
<seg id=446>North Korea military has charged the United States for repeated violation of the armistice agreement .

<seg id=457>A Jakarta official quoted city governor Sutiyoso as saying a wall could be built , but the prerequisite is to build it three meters from the current fence inside the embassy compound .</seg>
<seg id=458>In addition , the embassy should lay turf and plant flowers between the two barriers to improve the appearance of the embassy compound .</seg>
<seg id=459>Sutiyoso said gardening and landscaping could reduce the impression that the U.S. embassy is a fort .</seg>
<seg id=460>The U.S. embassy in Jakarta had faced frequent protests before and after the U.S. led military actions in Afghanistan aimed at ousting the Taliban regime in 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=461>At that year , the related authority had stepped up security at the embassy after the previous ambassador protested that the police failed to curb the hard - line Islamic groups , which had been threatening the safety of Americans .</seg>

<seg id=475>( Agence France - Presse , Singapore , 24th ) - International Information Corp . said in a report released today that the Asia Pacific region will have more computer programmers and other professional researchers than North America within the next two years .</seg>
<seg id=476>North America had the largest concentration of researchers in 2001 . The Asia Pacific had replaced Europe and became the region possessing the second largest researcher population in the world .</seg>
<seg id=477>International Information 's report said the strong growth in China and India could push Asia Pacific to the number one position by 2005 .</seg>

<seg id=483>Research Indicates a Father 's Genes May Influence the Timing of His Child 's Birth</seg>
<seg id=484>( Agence France - Presse , Paris , 28th ) - According to a Danish research to be published in coming Saturday 's issue of the weekly British Medical Journal , a father 's genes may influence the timing of his child 's birth .</seg>
<seg id=485>About five percent of the expectant mothers experienced a post-term delivery , which is a pregnancy with a length of 294 days or more .</seg>
<seg id=486>At present , it is known that the problem may cause health complications for mother and child , but why it happens is an enigma .</seg>
<seg id=487>Danish researchers tracked 43,000 births between 1980-92 . Women with at least two children and , whose first pregnancy was a post-term delivery , were listed as targets .</seg>
<seg id=488>Only the first two deliveries were used in the analysis .</seg>
<seg id=489>In general , nearly 20 percent of the women who came through a prolonged first pregnancy had the same experience in their second pregnancy .</seg>
<seg id=490>However , this figure fell to just over 15 percent when the first and second child had different fathers .</seg>
<seg id=491>Annette Wind Olesen , the lead author of the research report , told Agence France - Presse , " That is a lot .</seg>
<seg id=492>That means if you have the same partner ( for your second child ) , you have a 30 - percent greater likelihood of a prolonged pregnancy compared with someone who has changed partner . "</seg>
<seg id=493>The research report said , " The risk of recurrence of post-term delivery was reduced when women changed partner between pregnancies .</seg>
<seg id=494>We believe this is a new observation .</seg>
<seg id=495>This result suggests that the timing of birth may , in part , be determined by the father 's genes . "</seg>

<seg id=542>Xinhua News Agency , Washington , January 8 ( Reporter : Tan Xinmu ) - Richard Lehner , spokesman of Missile Defense Agency , U.S. Department of Defense said on the 8th that U.S. military decided to skip two scheduled missile intercept tests in the first half of this year , because the development of a new rocket booster , used for launching the interceptor , was arrear of original schedule .</seg>
<seg id=543>Lehner told media here that the Missile Defense Agency has to concentrate on solving the rocket booster problem this year . The next missile intercept test will take place in autumn after Boeing Company produces a new rocket booster .</seg>
<seg id=544>Under the original schedule , Boeing Company was to conduct flight tests of a new type of rocket booster that could carry the " interceptor " starting from 2000 . However , that was delayed due to technical reasons .</seg>
<seg id=545>After a launch of the rocket booster failed in December 2001 , the Boeing Company decided to re-design the rocket booster , which was scheduled to complete in autumn this year .</seg>
<seg id=546>U.S. military used modified Minuteman rockets as booster in the last 8 ground - based missile intercept tests . However , the result of this type of booster was not satisfactory .</seg>
<seg id=547>The missile intercept test in July 2000 and December last year had both failed because the " interceptor " did not separate properly from the rocket booster .</seg>

<seg id=640>Last year , Customs at Luohu detected 1023 cases of money smuggling involving more than 150 million Renminbi . Among these cases , 15 cases had a single case value of more than 500 thousand Renminbi ( excluding cases involving foreign currency money orders ) .</seg>
<seg id=641>As China 's biggest tourist inspection port , the Luohu Customs is given the job to supervise a tourist flow of 250 thousand person - times a day . If the rather common phenomenon of carrying more than the permitted amount of money is not tightly controlled , then there could be a considerable amount of currency drain every day .</seg>
<seg id=642>Facing a situation like this , the Customs at Luohu have finally adopted strict monitoring measures , including more frequent and more careful checks , in order to keep a sharp eye on possible money drain from China .</seg>
<seg id=643>At about 9:00 a.m. on February 19 last year , a custom officer spotted a middle age woman who was pulling a suitcase and moving along in a very fast pace .</seg>
<seg id=644>As the luggage case passed through the inspection machine , the custom officer noticed some suspicious object inside the suitcase . The officer requested the tourist to open the suitcase for inspection and was astonished to find three large bundles of Hong Kong Dollars in thousand dollar bills inside a black plastic bag . The total value was 3 million Hong Kong Dollars .</seg>
<seg id=645>That was the most serious case of a tourist carrying cash items in excess of permitted limit at Luohu Customs in two years .</seg>
<seg id=646>Around July and August last year , offshore " black market money changers " attempted to smuggle a large quantity of foreign currency out of China . These changers wanted to take advantage of the massive tourists flow in summer holiday , as well as the renovation undergoing at the Luohu port , which caused officers to work in a crowed environment .</seg>
<seg id=647>The Customs at Luohu attached high importance to the issue and re-deployed manpower on a priority basis . The officers were determined to crack down any foreign currency smuggling activities by " black market money changers " .</seg>
<seg id=648>During July 2 to August 11 , Customs at Luohu detected 4 cases of foreign currency smuggling by " black market money changers " , which had an equivalent value of 1.46 million Renminbi .</seg>

<seg id=706>U.S. personal consumption expenditures , the main power for economic growth , increased by 0.9 percent in December last year , and was the largest one month growth since July last year .</seg>
<seg id=707>That growth included an increase of 6.1 percent in spending on durable goods and a small increase of 0.2 percent in spending on non-durable goods and services .</seg>

<seg id=709>Personal consumption expenditures , which accounted for two - thirds of U.S. Gross Domestic Products , showed a scant increase of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of last year . That growth was far lower than 4.2 percent in the third quarter and was the lowest quarterly growth since the first quarter of 1993 .</seg>
<seg id=710>Economic analysts believed that uncertain factors , including the looming U.S. war against Iraq , sharp decline in stock market and a soft job market etc. , had inhibited the zeal to consume , which , in turn , becomes an important factor for a rapid slowdown in the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter .</seg>

<seg id=720>They accused that the French government had forced Gbagbo to accept the composition of the new government . They also claimed that Diarra is a " Prime Minister of the French people " and threatened to kill him .</seg>

<seg id=726>Marc Garneau , Canadian Space Agency President and Canada 's first astronaut , said some scheduled missions for the International Space Station might be delayed pending U.S. investigation on the Columbia accident . Some plans might be carried out at a later date but some might be cancelled .</seg>
<seg id=727>Canadian astronauts Steve MacLean and Dave Williams were to join flights set for May and November this year , respectively .</seg>
<seg id=728>The two astronauts are currently receiving training in Houston , United States .</seg>

<seg id=736>The report said residential construction spending amounted to US $434.6 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in December last year , up 2.9 percent over November .</seg>
<seg id=737>Analysts believed the low interest rate was an important factor for the strong growth in residential construction spending .</seg>
<seg id=738>At present , U.S. Federal Reserve Committee maintains short - term interest at 1.2 percent , which is the lowest level in 41 year .</seg>
<seg id=739>However , U.S. commercial construction spending showed an opposite trend to that of residential construction . In December last year , U.S. commercial construction spending was US $158.6 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate , a decrease of 1.9 percent over November .</seg>
<seg id=740>Analysts believed enterprises were unwilling to increase investments in factories and other facilities because there were uncertain factors affecting the future prospect of the U.S. economy .</seg>
<seg id=741>In addition , worries of terrorists ' attacks also weighted against commercial construction activities . President George W . Bush signed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act in November last year but the law cannot remove all concerns of investors and businesses .</seg>
<seg id=742>Judging from the performance of the whole year , the growth rate of U.S. residential construction spending decreased from 2.7 percent in 2001 to 0.4 percent , which was the lowest level since 1991 .</seg>

<seg id=843>( International ) Austrian Researchers Found the Spinal Cells Responsible for Chronic Pain</seg>
<seg id=844>Xinhua News Agency , Vienna , February 20 ( Reporter : Lin Chuan ) - Researchers from Austria 's University of Vienna found a set of neuro - cells , which possesses long - lasting memory capability and shows a strong excitation on any slight pain stimulus . This could be another step forward for the identification of the causes of chronic pains .</seg>
<seg id=845>Sufferers of chronic pain are highly sensitive to pains and in the course of time , must endure pains in their daily lives .</seg>

<seg id=848>The stronger the pain stimulus is , the stronger the reaction .</seg>
<seg id=849>However , they differ from other neuro - cells in that this set of spinal cells become over sensitive to pain stimulus . They break out even on the stimulus of insignificant pains .</seg>
<seg id=850>Researchers also found that spinal cells have a special channel . When the cells were stimulated , the channel would open , calcium ions poured in and triggered further chain reactions .</seg>
