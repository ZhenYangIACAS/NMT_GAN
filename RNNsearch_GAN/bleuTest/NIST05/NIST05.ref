<seg id=1>bahraini princess marries a u.s. soldier ; astounding marriage dissolves in 5 years</seg>
<seg id=2>u.s. television stations had once feted the marriage between bahraini princess meriam al - khalifa and u.s. marine johnson . however , after just five years , this star - crossed marriage has already come to an end in the desert casino city of las vegas .</seg>
<seg id=3>meriam is a member of the royal family of the gulf country of bahrain . johnson risked his military career over this forbidden love affair . their fairy - tale marriage was once the theme of a television movie .</seg>
<seg id=4>nonetheless , according to the las vegas review journal , only five years later , the couple went to court when meriam filed for divorce in las vegas , where getting married is quick but getting divorced is quicker .</seg>
<seg id=5>the two met in 1999 , when johnson was still a career military man stationed in bahrain .</seg>
<seg id=6>after he met this teenage princess , the pair fell in love and his life thus changed tremendously .</seg>
<seg id=7>since the royal family forbade the union of these two young lovers , johnson smuggled meriam out of her country and into the united states by disguising her in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap , and forging her military identification papers .</seg>
<seg id=8>after fighting a difficult immigration battle with the u.s. authorities , the couple was finally married at the candlelight wedding chapel on the las vegas strip , famous for its opulence . at that time , johnson was 23 , and the bride was only 19 .</seg>
<seg id=9>however , johnson stated that because of the many temptations in las vegas , so - called " sin city , " the continuous tensions between him and meriam 's rich and powerful family , and the rumor of plots to assassinate him , this marriage , which had endured all kinds of hardships , finally dissolved .</seg>
<seg id=10>johnson said that he worked as a parking valet for hotel and casino guests , while meriam gradually got sucked into the nightlife of the casino city . she frequented nightclubs late at night and ignored her husband .</seg>
<seg id=11>meriam left her husband a year ago .</seg>
<seg id=12>johnson said , " she 's gone off the deep end . "</seg>
<seg id=13>this week 's eurozone indicators shows a continually weak european economy</seg>
<seg id=14>economists said that the economic indicators to be announced by eurozone this week would provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output , while british data is expected to show a growth in industrial activities .</seg>
<seg id=15>they said that economic output data from the largest eurozone countries will continue to show great volatility every month , but the long - term trend will demonstrate a slow down in economic growth .</seg>
<seg id=16>this week 's key figures will be in germany . the closely watched economic expectations index , which is expected to be released on the 7th by the zew economic institute , will provide the first evidence of december 's economic confidence in europe .</seg>
<seg id=17>the zew index plummeted to 13.9 in november from 31.3 in the previous month .</seg>
<seg id=18>in a recent survey , economists indicated that the substantial appreciation of the euro will continue to affect economic confidence , thus there is no reason to anticipate a rebound in the economic expectations index .</seg>
<seg id=19>a bnp economist said , " given that the main factors negatively affecting economic confidence - the appreciation of the euro , uncertainty over global growth , and the weak labor market and increasing unemployment in germany - have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the december survey period , a strong rebound is unlikely . "</seg>
<seg id=20>according to a survey conducted by afx news , the afp financial news subsidiary , economists believed that this index would drop again to 11 in december from 13.9 in the prior month .</seg>
<seg id=21>nevertheless , teather of ubs investment bank said that the zew economic expectations index of germany might even fall to zero in december .</seg>
<seg id=22>teather said , " according to our view , expectations of future german economic activity , as reflected in the zew survey of analysts and financial market participants , will continue to fall . "</seg>
<seg id=23>ukrainian crisis creates east - west tensions ; expected to be on osce meeting agenda</seg>
<seg id=24>russia has repeatedly accused the west of interfering in eastern european affairs . the issue has become the focus of attention due to the political crisis in ukraine . it will also be at the top of the agenda of tomorrow 's annual ministers meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) .</seg>
<seg id=25>the creeping western influence into corners of europe previously considered by russia as its backyard , such as the baltic states , georgia , and central asia , has long disgruntled russia . thus , recent incidents in ukraine will probably dominate the two - day osce meeting to be held in sofia , the capital city of bulgaria .</seg>
<seg id=26>the supreme court of ukraine has made the dramatic decision to order a rerun of the recent runoff of the presidential election . prior to that , the european union has already appealed to the osce member states to prepare their observers to " take action as quickly and efficiently as possible . "</seg>
<seg id=27>europeans revealed that the number of observers dispatched by osce to the election rerun in ukraine scheduled to be held on december 26 would increase from the original 600 to 1,000 .</seg>
<seg id=28>u.s. secretary of state powell will attend this osce annual meeting , which may be his last foreign visit before leaving office .</seg>
<seg id=29>russian foreign minister lavrov , french foreign minister barnier , british foreign secretary straw , and german foreign minister fischer will also attend the meeting .</seg>
<seg id=30>members of osce include 55 nations in north america , europe , and asia . the organization will celebrate its 30th anniversary next year .</seg>
<seg id=31>the organization was established at the helsinki conference that very year and contributed to the ending of the cold war .</seg>
<seg id=32>congress ' vote on intelligence overhaul bill this week a crucial test for bush</seg>
<seg id=33>the u.s. congress will push hard to pass the intelligence overhaul bill this week . the bill is an ambitious second - term agenda for republican president bush . his support among the republican congressmen will face its first major test after his reelection .</seg>
<seg id=34>kean , the former republican new jersey governor responsible for the investigation of the terrorist attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , said during an interview with the press that the issue of the intelligence overhaul bill is that congress has to approve it . this matter alone presents unfavorable signs for future cooperation between the two parties and the president 's domestic policies .</seg>
<seg id=35>kean said , " congress becomes dysfunctional if the president and congress can n't get these big issues taken care of , and then we 're all in trouble . "</seg>
<seg id=36>he told the new york daily news , " it 'll be a long time before there 's another bill with the support of the republican and democratic leadership in both houses and the support of 80 percent of the american people in the polls . "</seg>
<seg id=37>several congressmen stated yesterday that if this groundbreaking reform bill failed , it would delay the overhaul of the u.s. antiquated intelligence network for months , years , or even kill its existence entirely .</seg>
<seg id=38>harman , ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee , stated on cnn , " if the bill is n't passed this week , it dies . "</seg>
<seg id=39>the congress will try to pass the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 again on the 6th and the 7th . it will then adjourn until next year .</seg>
<seg id=40>if it is vetoed , the bill will be annulled and the congress will rewrite a new bill in the 2005 session .</seg>
<seg id=41>ukrainian opposition party firmly rejects constitutional - reform bill that drastically curbs presidential power</seg>
<seg id=42>the pro-western opposition party in ukraine today insisted that it would not accept the constitutional amendments advanced by outgoing president kuchma before the rerun of the presidential election .</seg>
<seg id=43>this constitutional reform will strip most of the power currently held by the president .</seg>
<seg id=44>after the supreme court annulled the results of the rigged runoff election held on november 21 , the central election commission ordered a rerun on december 26 . opposition leader yushchenko is again at loggerheads with kuchma .</seg>
<seg id=45>tymoshenko , yushchenko 's ally , stated , " if the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form , all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament . this would be unacceptable . "</seg>
<seg id=46>she told reporters , " we hope that the president could appoint the chief of the intelligence bureau and the prosecutor - general so we can fight corruption and eliminate groups that control ukrainian politics and business circles . "</seg>
<seg id=47>due to his worry that the opposition party may win in the presidential election , kuchma , who has close ties with russia , advanced the constitutional reform ahead of the reelection .</seg>
<seg id=48>yesterday , opposition party members in the parliament refused to vote on the constitutional - reform bill put forward by the government . as a result , the parliament will recess for 10 days .</seg>
<seg id=49>according to the constitutional amendment bill , the authority to appoint all top officials except the prime minister , the defense minister , and the foreign minister will be transferred from the hand of the president to the parliament , in which pro-government forces currently have a close majority .</seg>
<seg id=50>according to the constitutional amendment bill , the appointment of the prime minister , defense minister , and foreign minster by the president have to be approved by the parliament , while the parliament can also name their own candidates .</seg>
<seg id=51>third week of ukrainian political crisis ; opposition party calls for a continuous resistance</seg>
<seg id=52>the chaos sparked off by the presidential election in ukraine has entered its third week . opposition leader yushchenko called on his supporters to continue their street protests and their blockade of the presidential palace and government buildings , until outgoing president kushma fires prime minister yanukovych and his cabinet , and to take actions to ensure justice in the upcoming rerun of the presidential runoff election .</seg>
<seg id=53>tens of thousands of yushchenko 's supporters have gathered in the capital city of kiev for two weeks . they surround government buildings and camp out on major roads designed by russian specialists for viewing military marches . their demonstration of the power of the masses has forced the supreme court to declare the presidential election on november 21 invalid . the central election commission ordered a new election on december 26 and the parliament has approved the dismissal of yanukovych . however , kushma still has not signed the administrative order to replace the successor , whom he fostered personally .</seg>
<seg id=54>yushchenko told the supporters gathered at the independence square tonight that kushma should replace his government and reshuffle the central election commission , and that both the parliament and kushma should agree to amend the election law in order to prevent any electoral fraud .</seg>
<seg id=55>in his speech that unveiled the runoff on december 26 , he stated , " before these decisions are implemented , we should not discuss lifting the blockade of government buildings and the presidential palace .</seg>
<seg id=56>during these 2 weeks , this square has demonstrated its ardent love for ukraine , and the civil awareness of tens of millions of ukrainians who can defend their choices . "</seg>
<seg id=57>he stated , " we are going through a struggle between the good and evil powers . the whole world is cheering for our victory and the entire world is proud of ukraine . "</seg>
<seg id=58>while the opposition party exerts more pressure on the governing authorities backed by moscow , and yushchenko and kushma are at a deadlock once again on constitutional reform , polish president kwasniewski , lithuanian president adamkus , and russian envoy gryzlov are scheduled to arrive in kiev on the 6th for another effort at mediation .</seg>
<seg id=59>egypt announces breakthrough in middle east peace predicament</seg>
<seg id=60>egypt stated that a new structure is anticipated for the middle east peace agreement .</seg>
<seg id=61>it also said that it might dispatch an ambassador to israel again in the near future to resume full diplomatic relations , which have been severed for four years .</seg>
<seg id=62>the state - run middle east news agency in egypt cited " senior " egyptian figures as saying that all parties seeking a peace plan are gradually coming to a consensus regarding the overall reconciliation .</seg>
<seg id=63>the middle east news agency stated , " egypt , israel , palestine , and important international entities such as the united states and the european union have reached an important understanding and have agreed in principle to resolve the israel - palestine clashes completely . "</seg>
<seg id=64>since the death of palestinian strongman arafat last month , the international community resumes the advancement of the middle east peace policy , hoping to end prolonged bloodshed between israel and palestine as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=65>the middle east news agency reported that officials expect " the preparation work will continue until july and political action will be taken afterwards . "</seg>
<seg id=66>the middle east news agency indicated that afterwards , parties that are concerned about the middle east peace progress , including israel , palestine , egypt , the united states , russia , and a few european countries , would hold a meeting in washington .</seg>
<seg id=67>it is expected that the agenda for the meeting will include a " ceasefire on both sides , " and palestinian authorities will " stop anti-israeli attacks and strengthen its control on the gaza strip and west bank . "</seg>
<seg id=68>in regards to this , the middle east news agency reported that israeli prime minister sharon promised , " as long as palestinian authorities honor the armistice agreement and have control over their territories , israel will stop its military action on the palestinians . "</seg>
<seg id=69>over 1 billion children worldwide suffer from war , poverty , and hiv / aids</seg>
<seg id=70>an annual report published by unicef today shows that over 1 billion children , half of the world 's children , suffer from poverty , war , and hiv / aids .</seg>
<seg id=71>unicef pointed out that the rights of children to have a healthy and protected upbringing stated clearly in the 1989 convention on the rights of the child are frequently denied , partly because of governments ' failure to implement human rights and economic reforms .</seg>
<seg id=72>during the launch of the annual report in london , unicef executive director bellamy pointed out , " when half the world 's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy , when schools have become targets and whole villages are being emptied by aids , we 've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood . "</seg>
<seg id=73>bellamy added , " too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually will hurt childhood . "</seg>
<seg id=74>data compiled jointly by researchers at unicef , the london school of economics , and bristol university reveals a gruesome picture of children in dangerous situations in most parts of the world .</seg>
<seg id=75>researchers discovered that about 640 million children worldwide lack proper shelter , 400 million children do not have access to safe drinking water , 270 million children do not have health care services , and 140 million children ( mostly girls ) have never attended school .</seg>
<seg id=76>researchers pointed out that a more serious fact is that at least 700 million children suffer from all forms of " extreme deprivation , " including lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities .</seg>
<seg id=77>the 10th annual report released by unicef today indicates that wars and hiv / aids have destroyed all the networks that are usually able to protect children . moreover , children are often the direct victims of wars and hiv / aids .</seg>
<seg id=78>eu resists chinese pressure to lift arms embargo</seg>
<seg id=79>the european union today rejected pressure from chinese premier wen jiabao for a quick end of the arms embargo on china . however , it also indicated that it would strive toward lifting this 15 - year - old embargo .</seg>
<seg id=80>the netherlands , the eu rotating presidency , made the above statement after the sino - eu summit .</seg>
<seg id=81>the netherlands stated that how eu will end this embargo should not be wildly speculated .</seg>
<seg id=82>the eu imposed the arms embargo on beijing after the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .</seg>
<seg id=83>even though the arms embargo issue had cast a shadow over the sino - eu summit , the two sides still signed a number of trade and other agreements .</seg>
<seg id=84>both china and the eu claimed that these agreements have strengthened their " strategic partnership . "</seg>
<seg id=85>in a joint declaration released after the summit with chinese premier wen jiabao , the eu stated , " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work toward lifting the embargo . "</seg>
<seg id=86>the declaration stated that the chinese delegate " welcomed the positive sign and considered it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between china and the eu . "</seg>
<seg id=87>wen jiabao did not hide his displeasure at the press conference after the summit . he said that this embargo " does not reflect the partnership between china and the eu . "</seg>
<seg id=88>wen jiabao stated , " the embargo is a product of the cold war . it neither reflects the current situation nor the partnership between china and the eu . "</seg>
<seg id=89>some eu nations , spearheaded by france , encouraged the lifting of this arms embargo , stating that it is out - dated .</seg>
<seg id=90>without the amendment and strengthening of eu 's related laws , critics worry that the lifting of the embargo could open the floodgates for arms sales and boost china 's military strength .</seg>
<seg id=91>balkenende , prime minister of the netherlands , claimed , " i explained that within the eu there is a willingness to lift the embargo , but i also explained that this is related to adjusting the code of conduct on arms exports . "</seg>
<seg id=92>preliminary findings : possible link of folic acid to breast cancer , but results inconclusive</seg>
<seg id=93>a recent health study suggests that a b vitamin ( folic acid ) commonly used by pregnant women to prevent birth defects may increase the chance of breast cancer .</seg>
<seg id=94>nonetheless , researchers stated that their results might be a chance finding , because other research suggests that folic acid will in fact lower the risk of breast cancer . thus , they advised pregnant women to continue taking this supplement .</seg>
<seg id=95>folic acid naturally exists in dark green vegetables and it is already known in medical circles that this is an important aid in the development of the fetus .</seg>
<seg id=96>researchers from the university of bristol and the university of aberdeen in britain followed 3,000 women who had taken 5 mg or 0.2 mg dose of folic acid or a placebo , mostly during their second and third trimesters of pregnancies in the 1960s .</seg>
<seg id=97>this research , published in the british medical journal , showed that by september 2002 , those who had taken 5 mg doses of folic acid were twice as likely to have breast cancer as those who took only the placebo .</seg>
<seg id=98>ness , one of the researchers , stressed that these results present " preliminary findings that are intended to point the way toward further research . "</seg>
<seg id=99>he stated , " it is entirely possible that this is a chance finding -- so further scientific studies are required to examine the association , if there is one , before we reach any conclusions . "</seg>
<seg id=100>ness said that women planning to become pregnant should continue to take folic acid supplements .</seg>
<seg id=101>he claimed that the current recommended dosage and " the experimental dosage are considerably different . "</seg>
<seg id=102>according to the uk 's health standards , women planning to become pregnant and those who are in their first trimester of pregnancies should have 0.4 mg of folic acid everyday , which is more than 10 times lower than the dosage taken by the women in the above study .</seg>
<seg id=103>two candidates face ukrainian presidential rerun in completely different mood</seg>
<seg id=104>the two rivals who will face off for the ukrainian presidential rerun on the 26th of this month are geared up for the match .</seg>
<seg id=105>western - leaning opposition leader yushchenko is confident of winning while pro-russian current prime minister yanukovich declared that he is no longer running for the " shameful " ruling party .</seg>
<seg id=106>meanwhile , russian president putin changed his attitude towards ukraine 's entering into the european union and expressed his pleasure to see it happen .</seg>
<seg id=107>when asked about the percentage of votes he expected to get in the rerun , yushchenko told the reporters who filled the venue of the press conference , " conservatively speaking , i should have about 60 percent of the votes . "</seg>
<seg id=108>on the other hand , the anxious - looking yanukovich , who ducked several of the reporters ' questions , only said , " we will win as per god 's will " at the end .</seg>
<seg id=109>yanukovich , the original anointed successor of current president kuchma , has changed his course and cast himself as the candidate who is fighting against the opposition party and the ruling party .</seg>
<seg id=110>he was close to mentioning names when he said , " i used to trust those cowards and traitors who worked in the government , but now i am very disappointed . this government is very shameful . "</seg>
<seg id=111>kuchma made a deal with the opposition party to transfer part of the presidential power to the parliament through a legislative amendment in order to end the opposition party 's large - scale protest and political turmoil that has lasted for two weeks since the presidential runoff on november 21 .</seg>
<seg id=112>the supreme court also declared the original victory of yanukovich invalid because of the rigged election process and ordered a rerun to be held .</seg>
<seg id=113>powell 's visit to hague a final push for europe - us harmony before leaving office</seg>
<seg id=114>u.s. secretary of state powell held a meeting with eu senior officials today for a last attempt at bringing cohesion between the united states and the eu before his leaving office .</seg>
<seg id=115>powell 's european visit aims at repairing the diplomatic relations harmed by the iraq war . the hague is the last stop of his visit .</seg>
<seg id=116>this might be powell 's last official overseas visit . the eu promised him that they will work towards easing strained ties ahead of u.s. president bush 's european visit next february .</seg>
<seg id=117>nonetheless , differences between the two sides still exist .</seg>
<seg id=118>dutch foreign minister bot , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said , " we have to intensify the dialogue and rediscover some common ground in the second term of president bush . "</seg>
<seg id=119>eu external relations commissioner ms . waldner stated that she believed europe and the united states had already made some progress in " putting the difficult moments of the iraq crisis behind us . " however , she also realized that now is the " key moment in the eu - us relationship . "</seg>
<seg id=120>bush will meet with eu and nato leaders in brussels on february 22 , 2005 .</seg>
<seg id=121>powell stated that bush 's visit aims at mending the fissures caused by the iraqi factors .</seg>
<seg id=122>powell has visited sofia and brussels during this visit but has produced limited results in improving the relationships .</seg>
<seg id=123>especially in brussels , powell criticized the six anti-war nato members of hurting the " credibility and cohesion of the alliance " by not participating in the training exercises in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=124>nevertheless , powell insisted that his meeting has shown the commitment of the united states in reestablishing full diplomatic relationships .</seg>
<seg id=125>elected romanian president basescu faces challenges in forming government</seg>
<seg id=126>romanian opposition candidate basescu won the close presidential election today . however , the mayor of bucharest , who holds a center - right position , will probably face huge challenges in forming a new government because of the multi-partied and fragmented parliament .</seg>
<seg id=127>final official results announced by the romanian central election committee today showed that the justice and truth alliance candidate basescu won 51.23 percent of the votes while his rival , prime minister nastase , had 48.77 percent .</seg>
<seg id=128>nastase conceded defeat and congratulated basescu .</seg>
<seg id=129>the outgoing president iliescu had also congratulated basescu .</seg>
<seg id=130>nastase indicated that his social democratic party will assist basescu in gaining romania 's entry into the european union .</seg>
<seg id=131>the social democratic party won the parliamentary election held on the 28th of last month .</seg>
<seg id=132>basescu announced in a press conference , " today my priority is to form , as soon as possible , a government capable of continuing membership negotiations for romania to join the european union . " romania will have to continue to live up to the requirements of gaining entry into the european union .</seg>
<seg id=133>he stressed that romanians should understand the price they will have to pay for this integration . the nation should unite to ensure that there will be no questioning voices about this integration .</seg>
<seg id=134>romania has completed the negotiations on joining the european union and is expected to become a member in january 2007 .</seg>
<seg id=135>basescu also listed fighting poverty , eliminating corruption , and ensuring judicial independence as priorities of his governing policies .</seg>
<seg id=136>tumult over past work unsettled : oliver stone seeks peace with turkey</seg>
<seg id=137>movie director oliver stone is trying to use the opportunity of promoting his new movie " alexander " in istanbul to make peace with turkey .</seg>
<seg id=138>his screenplay for the classic " midnight express " has been criticized as tarnishing the image of turkey .</seg>
<seg id=139>he told afp in an interview here , " i never intended the screenplay to be against turkey . it was against injustice everywhere . "</seg>
<seg id=140>turks have condemned stone since the first screening of this award - winning movie in 1978 .</seg>
<seg id=141>this movie was adapted from the memoirs of billy hayes .</seg>
<seg id=142>hayes , an american youth who was caught at the istanbul airport for attempting to smuggle hashish out of the country , was sentenced to 30 years in a turkish prison following a protracted legal battle .</seg>
<seg id=143>turkish critics accused stone of taking liberties with rewriting hayes ' original work into a racist screenplay . all the turkish characters in the movie are depicted as villains without exception .</seg>
<seg id=144>the movie is also full of horrific prison scenes of rape and torture .</seg>
<seg id=145>stone admitted , " perhaps some of the zealousness , some of the anger came from being young and trying to make the point too much , too hard . "</seg>
<seg id=146>however , he added , " it was true that billy hayes did get sodomized in the turkish prison . he was convicted to a 30 - year prison term for an offense not worth mentioning , and he was also treated brutally in prison . so this is all based on the facts . "</seg>
<seg id=147>stone said , " the bigger picture is that turkey is not the only country whose prison system is not properly working . america has similar problems . "</seg>
<seg id=148>japanese economic growth may slow down next year</seg>
<seg id=149>the japanese economy may slow down in 2005 as a stronger yen and a widening gap between the rich and the poor may destroy the harmonic atmosphere the country enjoyed in the first half of the year .</seg>
<seg id=150>with huge corporate profits and strong consumer spending , japan has regained its confidence after 10 years of stagnation , but analysts rest their hopes for sustaining the economic growth on china despite the rising political tensions between the two countries .</seg>
<seg id=151>evidence has gradually shown that the japanese economy may suffer a temporary setback in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to fall while manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid overstock .</seg>
<seg id=152>according to the newly adopted statistical methodology , the japanese economy actually contracted slightly in the april - june quarter while it grew by just 0.1 percent in the july - september quarter , narrowly escaping a technical recession .</seg>
<seg id=153>at present , economists are still greatly divided over the robustness of the japanese economy .</seg>
<seg id=154>bnp paribas researchers anticipated a 2.3 percent growth in real terms in the current fiscal year that ends in march of next year and the next fiscal year .</seg>
<seg id=155>they called 2005 the " year of recovery " based on the reasons that the us economy has remained stable on the recovery track and japanese consumer spending is picking up the slack for slower exports .</seg>
<seg id=156>a more pessimistic note is that ufj institute economists predicted a mere 1.8 percent economic growth in this fiscal year and a lower 0.6 percent in the following year .</seg>
<seg id=157>they pointed out the " lurking risk , " meaning corporate profits have not led to higher personal gains .</seg>
<seg id=158>french foreign minister : middle east peace progress to test france - us relations</seg>
<seg id=159>after meeting with us secretary of state powell , french foreign minister barnier stated that the resumption of the middle east peace talks will be a " test " for their trans - atlantic ties .</seg>
<seg id=160>france had called for a quick convening of an international meeting to move forward the israel - palestine peace process after the death of palestinian leader arafat but there was no sign that an agreement had been reached after the meeting of barnier and powell .</seg>
<seg id=161>barnier flew from paris to washington for a lightning round of talks with powell and his designated successor rice , the national security advisor , then headed toward brussels for a european union summit .</seg>
<seg id=162>both paris and washington agreed to repair the strained relations brought about by the us invasion of iraq last year but differences are still obvious in resolving the middle east impasse .</seg>
<seg id=163>after a short meeting with powell at the state department , barnier stated , " we want to improve the future relations between the french and americans and europeans and americans . "</seg>
<seg id=164>he said , " i think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to launch the peace process between palestinians and israelis . "</seg>
<seg id=165>earlier this week , barnier called for the convening of an early international middle east conference in order to take advantage of what he called the " window of opportunity " presented after arafat 's death last month .</seg>
<seg id=166>however , powell remained non-committal .</seg>
<seg id=167>he said that the two discussed the british plan of a meeting with palestinian participants but had not mentioned whether a broader international meeting would be convened .</seg>
<seg id=168>us officials have made known that their most important task is to promote peace in israel and palestine , and to ensure the success of the palestinian election held next month .</seg>
<seg id=169>this election will produce a leader who can control the islamic militants and resume the israel - palestine talks .</seg>
<seg id=170>foreign minister machimura proposes fta talks with south korea in january</seg>
<seg id=171>japanese foreign minister machimura nobutaka proposed today to hold talks on signing a free trade agreement ( fta ) between japan and south korea as early as next january .</seg>
<seg id=172>jiji press reported that during his meeting with south korean foreign minister ban ki - moon in the southern city of ibusuki of kagoshima prefecture , machimura indicated that since tokyo and seoul both hoped to sign a fta agreement by the end of 2005 , the two parties should resume talks as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=173>before machimura 's talks with ban ki - moon , japanese prime minister koizumi junichiro and south korean president roh moo - hyun held a summit on the 17th in which roh moo - hyun urged tokyo authorities to be cautious in imposing economic sanctions on north korea .</seg>
<seg id=174>north korea had kidnapped several japanese nationals during the cold war and prime minister koizumi is under tremendous public pressure to punish north korea .</seg>
<seg id=175>the families of the kidnapped victims were furious after japanese researchers concluded that the remains that pyongyang provided to prove the death of two hostages did not belong to the victims .</seg>
<seg id=176>apart from the kidnapping issue , koizumi and roh moo - hyun both agreed that the six - nation talks that aim at checking north korean nuclear weapons expansion should recommence as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=177>since the standoff sparked by north korea 's secret nuclear weapons program in october 2002 , no concrete results have been achieved in the first three rounds of the six - nation talks .</seg>
<seg id=178>north korea later boycotted the fourth round of the six - nation talks scheduled to be held this september .</seg>
<seg id=179>the six nations that take part in the talks are south korea , north korea , the united states , china , japan , and russia , respectively .</seg>
<seg id=180>thai premier thaksin still expects to win february election</seg>
<seg id=181>thai premier thaksin is confident of winning his second four - year term when entering 2005 . however , his reputation was tarnished for not being able to suppress the bloody uprising of the separatist insurgents .</seg>
<seg id=182>a thai national election is scheduled to be held on february 6 , 2005 . thaksin and his political rivals are actively preparing for the election . most analysts expected him to win despite the serious violent clashes and the bird flu in the south .</seg>
<seg id=183>twelve people in thailand have died from bird flu this year . bird flu swept through most of the asian regions but was particularly serious in thailand . the thai government once admitted that it had " erred " in handling the epidemic .</seg>
<seg id=184>however , this health problem is unlikely to depose thaksin 's reelection . on the other hand , many people only asked how big a landslide his victory will be and what significance his victory will have on the muslim insurgency in the southern provinces .</seg>
<seg id=185>kraisak , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , told afp , " the phenomenon is that no matter how one looks at thaksin , he has managed to capture a vast support from the public for the time being . "</seg>
<seg id=186>he said , " but things will start to disintegrate next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and associates ) , the social injustices and the violence . "</seg>
<seg id=187>social injustices and violence are the causes of riots in the deep south of thailand where islam is the majority , and sporadic revolts have been happening since january .</seg>
<seg id=188>since january , muslim extremists have targeted buddhists , government officials , and security troops in their shootouts . they also carried out bombings and beheadings . up until now , more than 560 people have died and 100 have been reported missing .</seg>

<seg id=197>two weeks before the visit of the delegation mentioned by abdel rahman , the cabinet of israeli prime minister sharon decided to unseat arafat but did not specify by what means .</seg>
<seg id=198>israel 's threat had set off waves of support for arafat , who thus received several delegations of supporters .</seg>
<seg id=199>abdel rahman recalled , " arafat shook hands with people who had come to express their support for arafat in his confinement imposed by israel . "</seg>
<seg id=200>on september 25 of last year , arafat received two groups ; one was a global peace - advocating cyclist group while the other was a political activist group .</seg>
<seg id=201>abdel rahman indicated , " the last time he became ill , on october 12 , 2004 , he had the same symptoms : vomiting , loss of appetite , and all the symptoms that were similar to contracting a flu . "</seg>

<seg id=269>russian president putin stated today that the state 's purchase of russian oil giant yuko 's major asset was to protect the interests of the state . it is also the first re-nationalization action taken in the post-soviet era .</seg>
<seg id=270>when discussing the state - run petroleum company rosneft 's purchase of yuko 's subsidiary company , yuganskneftegaz , at the end - of - the - year press conference in the kremlin , putin stated , " today the state , using absolutely legal market mechanisms , is protecting its interests .</seg>

<seg id=277>putin defends the state - purchase actions by criticizing murky privatizations in the 1990s .</seg>
<seg id=278>the privatization policy at that time had allowed russia 's most valuable economic asset to fall into the hands of slick businessmen like khodorkorsky .</seg>
<seg id=279>baikal finance group won control of yuganskneftegaz earlier with a bid of u.s. $9.35 billion .</seg>

<seg id=348>in a telephone interview from jakarta , petersen said , " we are trying to sort it out , everyone has just come in , however , everyone has shown a great willingness to cooperate . "</seg>
<seg id=349>petersen stressed that the main concern of the who was to prevent the outbreak of epidemics such as cholera and diarrhea , which can cause tens of thousands of deaths .</seg>
<seg id=350>petersen said , " we are very worried since we have a large number of people displaced who do n't have sufficient clean water or adequate food supplies .</seg>
<seg id=351>so we have a situation that is very ripe for epidemic outbreaks . "</seg>
<seg id=352>nonetheless , petersen emphasized that there had not been any sign of such disease yet .</seg>
<seg id=353>the indonesian health ministry said that the death toll of the tsunami in sumatra may reach 100,000 people , with most of them in aceh .</seg>
<seg id=354>since most of aceh 's medical facilities had been destroyed , since last week the indonesian army and the governments of singapore and australia have set up at least eight field hospitals , while the united nations children 's fund has also begun distributing basic medical kits to help 200,000 children .</seg>
<seg id=355>powell predicts shiites to win in iraqi election</seg>
<seg id=356>u.s. secretary of state powell predicted today that the shiites will win in the upcoming iraqi election . however , he believed that since the iraqi and iranian shiites were on bad terms with each other before , it should not be a concern that the shiites ' victory may increase iranian influence in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=357>more and more evidence has shown that sunni muslims will either boycott the january 31 election or will be prevented from participating in the election by the iraqi authorities for spreading insurgency .</seg>
<seg id=358>powell said on nbc 's meet the press show , " the new government that comes into place in baghdad , the transitional national assembly , will be majority shiite .</seg>
<seg id=359>that 's the majority of the population . "</seg>
<seg id=360>shiite muslims made up more than 60 percent of the iraqi population ; most of them reside in southern and central iraq .</seg>
<seg id=361>the sunnis , who constitute 20 percent of the population , live in the central and western provinces .</seg>
<seg id=362>former foreign minister pachachi , who is the current leader of the iraqi independent democrats dominated by the sunnis , called for the postponement of the election today but powell claimed that the iraqi election will be held as scheduled .</seg>
<seg id=363>powell added that the control of the future iraqi government by the shiites does not mean that iran will have control of iraq 's political situation .</seg>
<seg id=364>he said , " my sense right now is that , even though there may be iranian influence - and iranians will try to influence the iraqi political situation , of course - there is a sufficient difference and past serious disagreements and conflicts between iranian and iraqi shiites . "</seg>
<seg id=365>international aid pours in ; tsunami victims racing against time</seg>
<seg id=366>overseas rescue troops are airdropping food and building clean water supply systems in tsunami - hit disaster areas in asia in order to help several million homeless and starving victims .</seg>
<seg id=367>figures showed that the death toll has reached almost 150,000 .</seg>
<seg id=368>relief supplies continue to pour in from governments while u.s. president bush appointed his father , bush senior , and former president clinton to be in charge of raising private aid .</seg>
<seg id=369>the delegation headed by u.s. secretary of state powell arrived in thailand last night to show u.s. concern and assess the relief work progress before the crisis summit in the indonesian capital of jakarta on the 6th .</seg>
<seg id=370>accompanying powell were jeb bush , younger brother of president bush and governor of florida ; and natsios , the chief of the u.s. agency for international development .</seg>
<seg id=371>powell will lead the delegation to tour thailand , indonesia , and sri lanka to inspect the disaster situation before attending the summit on the 6th .</seg>
<seg id=372>powell stated that the objective of his tour was to assess the disaster situation " and see what else we might need to do " but he will not make any immediate promise to increase the donations beyond the u.s. $350 million already pledged .</seg>
<seg id=373>after the disaster , talks of giving up the search for thousands of visitors who remain missing , most of them foreign tourists , have surfaced .</seg>
<seg id=374>however , thai prime minister thaksin vowed to continue the search in this country .</seg>
<seg id=375>thaksin told reporters at phuket island , " foreign experts have told me that they ( the missing ) may have been buried in mud in mangrove forests . we will continue to use our best efforts , and we will not stop searching . "</seg>
<seg id=376>the largest international rescue effort in history continues .</seg>
<seg id=377>the navy helicopters dispatched from the uss " abraham lincoln " were carrying out their second day of duties to airdrop relief materials and transport survivors in aceh indonesia .</seg>
<seg id=378>rear admiral crowder , commander of the lincoln , said 50,000 pounds of food and water had been delivered to the disaster areas , and the mission was " going great . "</seg>
<seg id=379>political tug - of - war behind tsunami relief efforts</seg>
<seg id=380>while asia 's tsunami relief supplies pour into the disaster areas , a less honorable activity is secretly underway as governments fight over who should give and who should receive , and who should lead the largest relief operation in modern times .</seg>
<seg id=381>the disaster that caused almost 150,000 deaths has revived old battles , including the disagreements between the united states , the united nations , and europe , and the struggle for leadership in asia .</seg>
<seg id=382>however , relief experts still hold cautious hope that the global nature of this disaster that hit so many countries may set a precedent : governments honor their promises to help .</seg>
<seg id=383>juma , professor of international development at harvard 's john f . kennedy school of government said , " there has never been an aid pledge for which governments have come through 100 percent and on time . "</seg>
<seg id=384>donations pledged by governments have reached u.s. $2 billion . important international figures including un secretary general annan and u.s. secretary of state powell , as well as leaders of australia , china , and japan , will hold a crisis summit with rich political overtones in jakarta on the 6th .</seg>
<seg id=385>after allegations of a slow response and the open criticism by top un relief official egeland of rich countries for being ' stingy , ' u.s. president bush has increased u.s. aid almost ten - fold to u.s. $350 million .</seg>
<seg id=386>in asia , the tsunami disaster has led to a covert race for regional influence . the increasingly confident china has pledged u.s. $60.5 million , a huge sum for a developing nation .</seg>
<seg id=387>japan , which has cut its foreign aid budget in six consecutive years , has also shattered talk of its declining national power by promising to provide at least u.s. $500 million , an amount that dwarfs all the other nations .</seg>
<seg id=388>world leaders to tour sri lankan disaster areas</seg>
<seg id=389>sri lankan officials stated that world leaders including un secretary general annan and u.s. secretary of state powell have arrived in sri lanka successively to personally examine the tsunami disaster situation that claimed 30,600 lives in the country at the end of last month .</seg>
<seg id=390>they said that powell had arrived , while south korean prime minister lee hae - chan was scheduled to arrive later that afternoon .</seg>
<seg id=391>a press release issued by the u.s. embassy said that powell will visit some of the hardest - hit areas by the tsunami disaster of december 26 , including the southern region of galle , where u.s. marines are stationed for relief operations .</seg>
<seg id=392>the south korean embassy said that lee hae - chan will be accompanied by the sri lankan premier to tour the western coastlines .</seg>
<seg id=393>the declaration said , " together with sri lanka 's premier rajapakse , the korean prime minister will travel along the western coast to have a first - hand view of the destruction of lives , livelihoods and property caused by the tsunami . "</seg>

<seg id=402>u.s. president bush said today that he was " heartened " by the strong turnout of today 's palestinian election and promised that the u.s. would enhance peace efforts .</seg>
<seg id=403>president bush said in a statement , " palestinians throughout the west bank and gaza took a key step toward building a democratic future by choosing a new president of the autonomous government in the election .</seg>
<seg id=404>observers of the election described it as a largely free and fair election . "</seg>
<seg id=405>he said , " this is a historic day for the palestinian people and for the people of the middle east . "</seg>
<seg id=406>exit polls showed that former prime minister abbas won the election with a landslide two thirds of the votes .</seg>
<seg id=407>he will succeed arafat to become the chairman of the palestinian autonomous government .</seg>
<seg id=408>bush stated , " these efforts - including today 's presidential elections and the parliamentary elections that will follow in several months - are essential for the establishment of a sovereign , independent , viable , democratic , and peaceful palestinian state . this new state will ensure the safety of israel . "</seg>
<seg id=409>he said that the u.s. government looks forward to working with the newly elected chairman of the palestinian autonomous government and the palestinians in the advancement of the cause of middle east peace .</seg>
<seg id=410>middle east peace meets the desire of the israelis and palestinians to coexist in peace and security .</seg>
<seg id=411>bush also called on israel to help improve the humanitarian and economic situations in the west bank and the gaza strip .</seg>
<seg id=412>he added , arab states must " take concrete steps with all related parties to create a regional environment conducive to peace , lend financial support to the palestinian people , and refuse to assist or harbor terrorists . "</seg>
<seg id=413>annan 's plan to visit sri lankan rebel - held regions obstructed</seg>
<seg id=414>un secretary general annan said today that he hoped to return to sri lanka one day and " see all parts of the country . "</seg>
<seg id=415>annan just finished his two - day visit to tsunami - ravaged areas in sri lanka , but reports said that the sri lankan government once stopped him from visiting rebel - held northern areas .</seg>
<seg id=416>when asked whether he was banned from visiting the rebel - held areas of the " liberation tigers of tamil eelam " as widely reported by many national newspapers , annan said , " i 'm hoping to come back and see all parts of the country and be of help to accelerate the peace process . "</seg>
<seg id=417>annan said that president kumaratunga was personally against his on - site visit to the guerrilla - controlled areas for fear that the rebels would use his visit as political capital .</seg>
<seg id=418>he stated , " i raised the question of the peace process and the need to intensify the efforts .</seg>
<seg id=419>i was also able to discuss that with president kumaratunga . "</seg>
<seg id=420>annan 's failure to visit the northern rebel - held area of jaffina had angered the residents . several hundred people protested in front of the un office in jaffina .</seg>
<seg id=421>however , the sri lankan government strongly denied the media report , saying that the media are " misleading " the issue .</seg>
<seg id=422>on the other hand , while relief efforts are in full swing , the sri lankan meteorological department warned that its coastline may be hit by a cyclone that is currently building off its coast .</seg>
<seg id=423>russian space agency denies rocket fuel causes illnesses in children</seg>
<seg id=424>the weekly - published british science journal nature reported that the highly toxic rocket fuel shot out during russia 's launch of space shuttles at kazakhstan 's baikonur space base is causing serous illnesses in nearby children , but russian space agency rosaviakosmos denied the allegation today .</seg>
<seg id=425>the issue of nature published today quoted research as saying that the levels of endocrine disease and blood disorders among residents of the polluted areas are twice as high as that in general areas .</seg>
<seg id=426>this research was conducted by a group of russian scientists headed by epidemiologist zykov .</seg>
<seg id=427>rosaviakosmos responded , " no direct influence of space - related activities on the population 's health has so far been established . "</seg>
<seg id=428>this research , cited in nature , focused on children in the altai republic .</seg>
<seg id=429>the altai republic is located in the mountainous region on the southern border of siberia .</seg>
<seg id=430>the altai republic was chosen as the research subject because of the pollution from unburnt fuel , especially hydrazine .</seg>
<seg id=431>part of russian 's space launch missions used hydrazine as fuel in the early stages .</seg>
<seg id=432>zykov compared the health records of approximately 1,000 children in the two polluted areas between 1998 and 2000 with 3,300 health records of children from nearby unpolluted areas in the control group .</seg>
<seg id=433>nature reported that zykov concluded that children from the worst - polluted areas who require medical treatment are twice as many as the unpolluted control group and their treatment time is twice as long .</seg>
<seg id=434>white house says iraqi election won n't be flawless</seg>
<seg id=435>the white house admitted today that the iraqi election scheduled for january 30 is " not going to be perfect . " meanwhile , two car bomb attacks happened in mosul , iraq , killing at least two iraqi soldiers .</seg>
<seg id=436>when asked whether he agreed with iraqi prime minister allawi , that violence would prevent some iraqi areas from voting , white house spokesman mcclellan said , " we all recognize that the election is not going to be perfect . "</seg>
<seg id=437>he said , " this is the first time iraqis will be able to freely choose their leaders . it 's for a transitional government , and it 's one of three elections that will take place over the course of this year . "</seg>
<seg id=438>mcclellan stated , " and so we 're going to do everything we can to help the iraqi people and the interim government ensure as broad a participation as possible in this upcoming election . "</seg>
<seg id=439>violent clashes broke out in iraq on the 11th , killing at least 25 people , six of whom died in a car bomb attack that happened in ex-president hussein 's hometown of tikrit . under such conditions , allawi acknowledged that some iraqi areas would not be able to take part in this month 's election .</seg>
<seg id=440>meanwhile , two car bomb attacks happened in mosul , iraq , today , killing at least two iraqi soldiers .</seg>
<seg id=441>u.s. army sergeant schaeffer told the afp that a truck exploded before it tried to attack a joint convoy of u.s. and iraqi military vehicles , killing an unknown number of civilians .</seg>

<seg id=443>u.s. november trade deficit hits record high of $60 billion</seg>
<seg id=444>figures announced by the u.s. department of commerce showed that u.s. exports shrunk 2.3 percent last november , sending the trade deficit to a record high of u.s. $60.3 billion .</seg>
<seg id=445>u.s. exports fell to a five - month low of u.s. $95.6 billion . meanwhile , as u.s. imported oil rose to u.s. $14.2 billion , an increase of over u.s. $2 billion or 1.3 percent , imports thus increased by 1.3 percent , reaching an all - time high of u.s. $155.8 billion .</seg>
<seg id=446>the trade deficit increased by 7.7 percent from last october 's revised u.s. $56 billion and a huge 50.8 percent increase from u.s. $40 billion in november the year before .</seg>
<seg id=447>according to a survey conducted by cbs marketwatch , wall street economists expected the trade deficit on goods and services would drop to around u.s. $53.3 billion .</seg>
<seg id=448>despite a weak u.s. dollar that makes goods produced in the u.s. cheaper at home and abroad , the u.s. trade deficit continues to expand .</seg>
<seg id=449>the report released by the commerce department today will add pressure on the dollar and revive appeals for washington to take action in u.s. energy independence and the resolution of the u.s. - china trade imbalance .</seg>
<seg id=450>a drop in u.s. exports last november was caused by a reduction of u.s. $1.4 billion in capital goods , including u.s. $325 million in aircraft and aircraft engines .</seg>
<seg id=451>industrial materials exports , mostly energy , fell by u.s. $800 million .</seg>
<seg id=452>automobile , consumer goods , and food exports also fell .</seg>
<seg id=453>japanese defense agency director - general : remembers militarist past , respects neighboring countries ' dignity</seg>
<seg id=454>japanese defense agency director - general ono yoshinori stated today that while japan adopts a higher international profile , it will not forget its militarist past and will remember the " dignity " of neighboring asian countries .</seg>
<seg id=455>when asked about the uneasiness caused by japan 's deployment of the self-defense forces to south asian tsunami disaster areas , ono said , " while we get along with southeast asian nations , we should never forget the past . "</seg>
<seg id=456>he told reporters , " we must build relations with friendly countries so that we can tell them that we have good intentions .</seg>
<seg id=457>we should pay full respect to the dignity of other countries while looking at the past as it was . "</seg>
<seg id=458>ono specifically mentioned that this year marked the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war . he said , " we want to be reborn and cooperate for the sake of a new era . "</seg>
<seg id=459>ono just finished his visit to several south asian tsunami - ravaged countries . he said that he felt the " dignity " of an independent nation when the indonesian leader told him that the japanese self-defense forces should finish their rescue mission no later than the end of march .</seg>
<seg id=460>the united nations has voiced its concern over the deadline imposed by the indonesian government on foreign troops .</seg>
<seg id=461>foreign troops received broad credit for rescuing tsunami survivors in remote areas .</seg>
<seg id=462>close to 1,000 japanese self-defense personnel are heading toward countries hit by the tsunami of december 26 . over 163,000 people died in this natural disaster .</seg>
<seg id=463>this is the biggest deployment of the japanese self-defense forces since the end of the second world war .</seg>
<seg id=464>the post-war constitution in japan dominated by the united states prohibits the use of force by the self-defense forces .</seg>
<seg id=465>political intervention in nhk program . japanese media touch off debates</seg>
<seg id=466>according to rumors , nhk toned down a program about women who were forced by the japanese army to become prostitutes during the second world war that aired a few years ago , due to pressure from political figures . japanese liberal media thus launched a dispute with their conservative colleagues on the issue .</seg>
<seg id=467>according to sources , nhk cut the majority of the interview contents in the program after discussing it with top politicians . most of the interviewees were critics of japanese wartime behavior and victims who were forced to become prostitutes . nhk 's action had solicited criticism from the liberal media .</seg>
<seg id=468>nonetheless , conservative newspapers defended nhk 's decision to revise the contents of the program , stating that the company 's senior officials had the responsibility to ensure the fairness and objectivity of the program 's contents .</seg>
<seg id=469>the dispute , which focused on a program aired in 2001 about a mock trial of the crime committed by the japanese army of forcing women to become prostitutes during the war , erupted last week .</seg>
<seg id=470>the trial was held by a japanese women 's rights group in december 2000 . the verdict found late emperor hirohito guilty of allowing the japanese army to commandeer prostitutes during the japanese occupation of asian countries .</seg>
<seg id=471>historians said that at least 200,000 young women were forced to become prostitutes at frontline japanese brothels during the war . most of them came from korea , but there were also women from taiwan , china , the philippines , and indonesia .</seg>
<seg id=472>the program 's producer , nagai satoru , blew the whistle in a tearful press conference on the 13th , saying that before the program was aired , nhk top officials had met with senators abe and nakagawa of the ruling liberal democratic party , who showed concern over the program contents .</seg>
<seg id=473>according to nagai , nhk top officials then re-edited the program and watered down its contents .</seg>
<seg id=474>he said , " nhk bowed to political pressures . "</seg>
<seg id=475>abe and nakagawa admitted that they had met with nhk personnel and told them that they had to be " fair " , but strongly denied that they had exerted pressure on the company .</seg>
<seg id=476>eurozone indicators show core inflation under control</seg>
<seg id=477>economists said today that eurozone indicators to be released this week would show that core inflation remains under control .</seg>
<seg id=478>meanwhile , both eurozone industrial output and french consumer spending are expected to fall .</seg>
<seg id=479>it is expected that the european union 's statistics service will confirm the inflation rate is up a little from 2.2 percent in november to 2.3 percent in december when it releases inflation figures on the 20th .</seg>
<seg id=480>but the increase is largely a reflection of tobacco tax increases , while the core inflation rate is expected to remain at 1.9 percent .</seg>
<seg id=481>core inflation figures and consumer price index figures will be released together .</seg>
<seg id=482>economists pointed out that core inflation , which excludes food , energy , tobacco , and alcohol prices , has remained at 1.6 to 2.0 percent for the past two years .</seg>
<seg id=483>european central bank president trichet stated on the 13th that short - term price pressures have dropped recently .</seg>
<seg id=484>although inflation will remain above 2 percent in the next few months , a decrease is expected by the end of the year .</seg>
<seg id=485>meanwhile , another economist stated that a decrease in eurozone november industrial output to be released on the 18th is expected due to a slowdown in growth in germany .</seg>
<seg id=486>german industrial output dropped 1.7 percent in november while economists surveyed by afp 's financial news subsidiary expected that eurozone output would decrease by 0.4 percent in november after a drop of 0.5 percent in october .</seg>
<seg id=487>schmieding of the bank of america said that eurozone output may rebound in december .</seg>
<seg id=488>bureaucracy blows second strike to tsunami victims</seg>
<seg id=489>three weeks after the assault of the worst tsunami in history , survivors are fighting pernicious habits of red tape and politicking . meanwhile , the world focus has shifted elsewhere .</seg>
<seg id=490>thousands of decomposed bodies are continuously being unearthed from the rubble , bringing the death toll of the december 26 tsunami to over 168,000 people . at the same time , the approaching iraqi election and president bush 's inauguration have replaced the tsunami as the headlines of the global media .</seg>
<seg id=491>indonesia originally ordered foreign troops who engaged in humanitarian missions to withdraw within three months but later rescinded this demand .</seg>
<seg id=492>in thailand , the leaders of canada , sweden , norway , and finland are meeting to discuss the reconstruction and body - identification work .</seg>
<seg id=493>nonetheless , the survivors are facing new challenges such as the delay in the distribution of relief materials that poured in from around the world , caused by the deep - rooted bureaucracy in indonesia .</seg>
<seg id=494>busriadi , a fisherman from a small village near banda aceh , the capital of aceh on sumatra island in indonesia , said , " we are like people who do not exist . we have been hit hard by the disaster , lost everything , and are famished . "</seg>
<seg id=495>he stated , " where is the food , the clothes , and other relief we see on television flowing into aceh ? "</seg>
<seg id=496>like thousands of other victims , busriadi lost his identification card and other official documents , thus turning his efforts in getting aid into a nightmare .</seg>
<seg id=497>despite his pleading with officials and bustling about everyday going through the formalities , the result is the same : no aid .</seg>
<seg id=498>zeng qinghong believed to have visited zhao ziyang at his death bed</seg>
<seg id=499>the hong kong - based information center for human rights in china stated that zeng qinghong , vice president of the people 's republic of china , visited the deposed former party secretary general of the chinese communist party , zhao ziyang , at the hospital before he passed away this morning .</seg>
<seg id=500>the information center said that according to zhao 's family , zen qinghong visited zhao at a beijing hospital at 6 a.m. today . zhao passed away about an hour later , at the age of 85 .</seg>
<seg id=501>zhao ziyang was once the party secretary general of the chinese communist party and the prime minister . he was ousted in 1989 for his opposition to the suppression by force of the democratic movement in tiananmen square . he was later held under house arrest and was considered an unwelcome figure by the government .</seg>
<seg id=502>the information center said that according to zhao 's family , the current premier , wen jiabao , who was once under zhao , did not visit him when he was terminally ill .</seg>
<seg id=503>nonetheless , before zhao ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th , tian jiyun , a retired central committee member who was once zhao 's assistance , went to visit him .</seg>
<seg id=504>the information center for human rights in china has kept contact with zhao 's family and has been releasing timely and accurate information on zhao ziyang 's situation for years .</seg>
<seg id=505>the information center indicated that approximately 20 retired key members of the party , the government , and the army planned to issue an open letter to the chinese communist party calling for the reevaluation of zhao ziyang 's contributions and asking to hold a public memorial service for him .</seg>
<seg id=506>the center added that zhao 's family would not be allowed to hold or make arrangements for the funeral ; all final decisions on related arrangements will be made by the party .</seg>
<seg id=507>liang baiqi , zhao ziyang 's wife , is 86 years old .</seg>
<seg id=508>the information center said that she had not been told of her husband 's death until this evening due to the poor condition of her health .</seg>
<seg id=509>democratization urged in china after zhao ziyang 's death</seg>
<seg id=510>after former chinese communist party leader zhao ziyang died of an illness today , people around the world spoke highly of him while japanese prime minister koizumi junichiro , the taiwan government , and overseas chinese democratic figures all called on beijing to implement zhao ziyang 's democratic reform ideas .</seg>
<seg id=511>zhao ziyang was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the military suppression of the tiananmen square democratic movement and had spent the rest of his life under house arrest . he passed away in a beijing hospital this morning at the age of 85 .</seg>
<seg id=512>according to jiji news services , japanese prime minister koizumi said , " i want them ( china ) to make efforts at democratization " while mourning zhao ziyang 's death .</seg>
<seg id=513>taiwan also urged china to implement democratic and political reforms after the death of zhao ziyang .</seg>
<seg id=514>overseas chinese democratic figures praised zhao ziyang as " one of china 's greatest reformers " who sacrificed his own political career to oppose the bloody crackdown on the democratic movement in tiananmen square .</seg>
<seg id=515>lian shengde , a former student movement leader and the president of the new york - based free china movement , said , " during his 15 years under house arrest , he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress toward the rule of law and democracy .</seg>
<seg id=516>zhao ziyang will be fondly remembered as a true democrat and a person of principle . "</seg>
<seg id=517>some democratic figures asked the chinese government to hold a public funeral for zhao ziyang and to provide fair assessments of his achievements .</seg>
<seg id=518>however , they admitted that zhao ziyang would not receive such courteous treatment , since the chinese government fears that people who are dissatisfied with communist rule will use this opportunity to stir up riots .</seg>
<seg id=519>the 1989 student movement was provoked by the death of reformist leader hu yaobang .</seg>

<seg id=563>( hong kong , macau , taiwan ) hong kong observatory to provide new services for wmo</seg>
<seg id=564>xinhua news agency , hong kong , december 12 - the hong kong observatory will launch two new services for the " world weather information service " and " severe weather information center " websites hosted by the world meteorological organization , starting december 2 .</seg>
<seg id=565>a spokesman for the observatory said that the two new services are to add a global official weather observation of cloudiness and rain to the " world weather information service " website and a recap function to display the tropical cyclone paths for the past seven days on the " severe weather information center " website .</seg>
<seg id=566>these two programs are another new service that the hong kong observatory is offering after it started providing the " severe weather information center " with official observation information of heavy rain ( including snow ) in areas around the world earlier this year .</seg>
<seg id=567>according to information , the " world weather information service " website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatological information for the world 's major cities .</seg>
<seg id=568>the new service , for the first time , provides global official weather observations with the cloudiness and rain distribution map as its first project introduced .</seg>
<seg id=569>the weather observation information on the new web page has a wide coverage and a high density , with eight scheduled updates per day .</seg>
<seg id=570>the new product of the " severe weather information center " website is to provide a recap function for displaying tropical cyclone paths .</seg>
<seg id=571>the previous design was that once the tropical cyclone dissipated , information including the location of the tropical cyclone would no longer be saved on the website .</seg>
<seg id=572>however , the public often still wants to obtain related information about the tropical cyclone a few days after it makes landfall .</seg>
<seg id=573>as a result , the new product will store information on the intensities , locations , and paths of tropical cyclones that have happened in the past seven days so the public and the media can still obtain desired information several days after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated .</seg>

<seg id=773>hard alloy is known as " industrial tooth . " it is used as cutting tools , high - pressure tools , and machineries for mining and road construction because of its extremely high hardness and wear - proof capability . the development of the hard alloy industry plays an important role in the entire growth of the tungsten industry .</seg>
<seg id=774>according to information , china 's alloy industry started in the 1950s of the 20th century , from the ground up . through continuous development , it has made outstanding achievements so far .</seg>

<seg id=795>the ivory pomegranate was once believed to be the only artifact discovered from the first temple , during king solomon 's era .</seg>
<seg id=796>snyder stated in a declaration that the israeli authorities had conducted a detailed examination on the thumb - sized ivory pomegranate .</seg>
<seg id=797>experts discovered that the relic should belong to the bronze age and is considerably older than the first jewish temple 's era .</seg>
<seg id=798>a line inscribed in hebrew lettering on the ivory pomegranate reads , " belonging to the temple of the lord ( yahweh ) , holy to the priests . "</seg>
<seg id=799>the inscription was verified to be added afterwards .</seg>

<seg id=801>archaeologists and antiquity experts once believed that it was a treasure mounted on the top of a priest 's scepter in the first temple , and the only relic left from that time .</seg>
<seg id=802>snyder claimed that before they bought the ivory pomegranate , israeli archaeologist nahman avigad and other experts had authenticated the relic .</seg>
<seg id=803>according to haaretz daily , avigad only used a magnifying glass to do a cursory check on the relic at that time .</seg>

<seg id=809>shenzhen enforces " middle - water " usage in buildings and small districts</seg>
<seg id=810>xinhua news agency , guangzhou , december 26 - shenzhen will enforce " middle - water " usage in some larger - scale buildings and small districts as a major measure in establishing " water - saving style " cities . at present , relevant specifications and regulations for the middle - water plan are being drawn up .</seg>
<seg id=811>middle - water mainly refers to non-drinking water from treated city and daily wastewater that has reached a certain water quality , and can be reused in certain areas .</seg>
<seg id=812>its water quality is between tap water and wastewater that goes down the drainage .</seg>
<seg id=813>in general , it is widely used for flushing toilets , watering gardens and farmlands , cleaning roads , washing cars , and supplementing the water in city fountains and cooling facilities .</seg>
<seg id=814>a study by shenzhen water works showed that in the mid 1990s of the 20th century , more than 70 buildings in shenzhen were equipped with the " middle - water " - recycling system . however , the cost of recycling for " middle - water " was too high due to technological , design , and management factors , thus forcing the construction unit to stop using it .</seg>
<seg id=815>only rmb 300,000 to 400,000 yuan of extra investment will be needed to install the " middle - water " - treatment system in order for these pipelines to perform their functions properly .</seg>
<seg id=816>if the more than 70 existing sets of " middle - water " pipelines are being used , according to the present daily usage of 500 tons of " middle - water " in small districts , it will save 35,000 tons of tap water for shenzhen per day .</seg>
<seg id=817>according to information , the shenzhen " middle - water " - recycling project will start with the remodeling of the more than 70 existing buildings that have the " middle - water " - recycling system . after summarizing the experience , the project will be further expanded .</seg>
<seg id=818>meanwhile , shenzhen water works will draw up specifications for the " middle - water " - plan with urban planning and development departments as soon as possible and will enforce " middle - water " usage in some larger - scale buildings .</seg>
<seg id=819>the treated " middle - water " will first be used in watering the trees in and around the city .</seg>

<seg id=3>meriam is a member of the gulf country bahrain 's royal family . johnson risked his army career over their forbidden love affair , their fairy - tale marriage became the subject of a television movie .</seg>
<seg id=4>but the las vegas review - journal reported that after only five years , the couple is headed to the court after meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town known for its quickie marriages and even quicker dissolutions .</seg>
<seg id=5>the pair met in 1999 when career military man johnson was stationed in bahrain .</seg>
<seg id=6>but his life changed dramatically when he met the beautiful teenage princess and the pair fell in love .</seg>
<seg id=7>their union was forbidden by the royal family , so johnson disguised meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap , forged her military identification papers and brought her out of her home country to america .</seg>

<seg id=37>several lawmakers said yesterday that failure of the groundbreaking reform bill could delay overhaul of america 's antiquated spy network by months , years or kill it altogether .</seg>
<seg id=38>the top democrat on the house of representatives ' intelligence committee , harman , yesterday told cnn television that " if the bill is n't passed this week , it dies " .</seg>
<seg id=39>congress will try again on the 6th and 7th to pass the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 before adjourning until early next year .</seg>
<seg id=40>if lawmakers fail , the entire bill will be discarded and need to be rewritten in the congress ' 2005 session .</seg>
<seg id=41>ukraine 's opposition strongly opposes large constitutional amendment to dilute presidential powers</seg>
<seg id=42>ukraine 's pro-west opposition firmly insisted today that they would not accept the constitutional reform pushed by outgoing ukrainian president kuchma before the second round presidential re-election .</seg>
<seg id=43>the constitutional reform will dilute most of the president 's powers .</seg>
<seg id=44>with the november 21st vote declared invalid by the supreme court because of massive vote fraud in the second - round presidential elections and a new date of re-election set by the central election commission for december 26 , opposition leader yushchenko is locked in a fresh standoff with kuchma .</seg>
<seg id=45>" if the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form , all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament . this would be unacceptable , " said timoshenko , an ally of yushchenko .</seg>
<seg id=46>" we want the president to be able to name the head of the intelligence agency and the prosecutor general so we can fight corruption and get rid of the clans that dominate ukraine 's political and business life , " she told reporters .</seg>
<seg id=47>kuchma , who keeps close ties to russia , had pushed for constitutional changes before the re-election amid fears that the opposition could win the presidential election .</seg>
<seg id=48>opposition lawmakers yesterday refused to vote for government - proposed constitutional changes and the parliament adjourned for 10 days .</seg>
<seg id=49>according to the constitutional amendment , the power to appoint all top posts excepting the prime minister , defense and foreign ministers would be transferred from the president to the parliament , where pro-government forces currently have close to a majority .</seg>
<seg id=50>according to the amendment , the president 's nominees for the prime minister , defense and foreign ministers would need to be approved by lawmakers , who could also put forward their own candidates .</seg>
<seg id=51>ukraine 's political crisis enters third week with opposition calling for continuous protest</seg>
<seg id=52>the chaos caused by ukraine 's presidential election has entered its third week . opposition leader yushchenko today called on his supporters to continue the street protests and block the presidential palace and government buildings unless outgoing president kuchma dismisses prime minister yanukovych and his cabinet members and takes actions to ensure the fairness of the upcoming presidential reelection .</seg>
<seg id=53>tens of thousands of yushchenko 's supporters have gathered in the capital of kiev for two weeks , blocking the government buildings and encamping themselves on major avenues designed by soviet experts to hold military parades . the people power they have demonstrated has forced the supreme court to annul the second round of presidential election of december 21st and the central election commission to order a reelection for december 26th . the parliament has approved the dismissal of yanukovych , but kuchma , yanukovych 's mentor , has not signed the administrative decree to fire his successor .</seg>
<seg id=54>yushchenko told supporters gathered at the capital 's independence square this evening that kuchma should dismiss his government , and reshuffle the central election commission . in addition , both the parliament and kuchma should agree to amend the election law to prevent election fraud .</seg>
<seg id=55>" before these decisions are made , the issue of blockade on government buildings and the presidential palace will not be discussed , " he said , starting his campaign for the december 26 election .</seg>
<seg id=56>" over the past 14 days , the square has shown the love for ukraine and the civil consciousness of millions of ukrainian people who can defend their own choice . "</seg>
<seg id=57>" we are undergoing a fight between good and evil . the world is applauding our victory and is proud of ukraine , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=58>as the opposition is putting more pressure on the ruling authority backed by moscow and yushchenko and kuchma are once again locked in a standoff of constitutional reform , polish president kwasniewski , lithuanian president adamkus and russian envoy gryszlov are scheduled to arrive in kiev on the 6th for another round of mediation .</seg>
<seg id=59>egypt announces breakthrough in stalled middle east peace process</seg>
<seg id=60>egypt says a new framework is expected to come into being for the middle east peace agreement .</seg>
<seg id=61>it also says it is likely to return its ambassador to israel in the near future to restore the full diplomatic ties severed four years ago .</seg>
<seg id=62>quoting " high - level " egyptian sources , egypt 's state news agency , the middle east news agency ( mena ) , said parties in the search for a peace plan have gradually reached an understanding that could lead to a comprehensive reconciliation .</seg>
<seg id=63>" an important understanding has been reached by egypt , israel , the palestinians and the significant international parties , such as the united states and the european union , agreeing in principle on a comprehensive solution to the israeli - palestinian conflict , " mena said .</seg>
<seg id=64>following the death last month of veteran palestinian leader arafat , the international community has revitalized its efforts to advance towards a final middle east peace policy in a bid to end at an early date years of bloody conflict between israel and palestine .</seg>
<seg id=65>mena said officials expect that " preparations would take place until july , after which political action will begin " .</seg>
<seg id=66>mena said it will be followed by a conference in washington attended by all parties concerned with the peace process , notably israel and palestine , as well as egypt , the united states , russia and several european countries .</seg>
<seg id=67>topics of the meeting are expected to include a " bilateral ceasefire " and the palestinian authority " putting a stop to anti-israeli attacks and consolidating its control over the situation in the gaza strip and the west bank . "</seg>
<seg id=68>for this point , mena said israeli prime minister sharon has promised to " stop israeli military operations against the palestinians insofar as they continue to respect the ceasefire deal and control their territory . "</seg>
<seg id=69>one billion children suffer from war , poverty and aids</seg>
<seg id=70>the united nations children 's fund ( unicef ) pointed out today in its annual report that more than 1 billion children , half of the world 's population of children , suffer from poverty , war and the scourge of aids .</seg>
<seg id=71>unicef says the rights of children to a healthy and protected upbringing , as laid out in the 1989 convention on the rights of the child , are regularly imperiled , due in part to the failure of governments to carry out human rights and economic reforms .</seg>
<seg id=72>unicef executive director bellamy pointed out during the release of the report in london that " when half the world 's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy , when schools have become targets of attacks and whole villages are being emptied by aids , we 've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood " .</seg>
<seg id=73>" too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually hurt childhood , " bellamy added .</seg>
<seg id=74>unicef has joined hands with researchers from britain 's london school of economics and bristol university to compile statistics which paint a terrible portrait of children at risk in most part of the world .</seg>
<seg id=75>researchers have found that around 640 million children lack adequate shelter , 400 million have no access to safe water , 270 million have no access to health care services and 140 million ( mostly girls ) have never been to school in the world .</seg>
<seg id=76>researchers point out that even worse is that at least 700 million children suffer from various forms of " severe deprivation " , which also includes a lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities .</seg>
<seg id=77>the 10th annual unicef report released today points out that war and aids have destroyed networks that normally protect children and at times turned them into direct victims of war and aids .</seg>
<seg id=78>eu resists chinese pressure to lift arms embargo</seg>
<seg id=79>the european union today rebuffed pressure for a quick end to the arms embargo on china from chinese premier wen jiabao , but said it was working towards lifting the 15 - year - old ban .</seg>
<seg id=80>the eu dutch presidency made the remarks following a china - eu summit .</seg>
<seg id=81>the netherlands says it cannot speculate how the eu will end the embargo .</seg>
<seg id=82>the eu imposed the arms ban on beijing after the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .</seg>
<seg id=83>although the arms embargo overshadowed the china - eu summit , the two sides have signed several trade and other agreements .</seg>
<seg id=84>both china and the eu claim that such deals have strengthened their " strategic partnership " .</seg>
<seg id=85>" the eu side has confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " said the eu in a joint statement made after the summit with chinese premier wen jiabao .</seg>
<seg id=86>the statement points out that the chinese delegation " welcomes the positive signal and considers it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between china and the eu . "</seg>
<seg id=87>wen jiabao did n't hide his displeasure at a press conference following the summit . he said the ban " does not reflect the partnership between china and the eu " .</seg>
<seg id=88>" the embargo is a result of the cold war and does not reflect the present situation nor the partnership between china and the eu , " wen jiabao said .</seg>
<seg id=89>a group of eu countries led by france is pushing for the arms ban to be lifted , saying the ban is outdated .</seg>
<seg id=90>but some in the eu worry that without a strengthened set of eu rules , a lifting of the embargo could open the floodgates to arms sales which could improve china 's military strength .</seg>
<seg id=91>" i have explained that the eu is willing to lift the embargo but i also must say that this is related to adjustments of the code of conduct on arms exports , " said dutch prime minister balkenende .</seg>
<seg id=92>preliminary research finds folic acid may be linked to breast cancer but link not confirmed</seg>
<seg id=93>a new health study points out that folic acid , a b vitamin widely taken by pregnant women to protect against birth defects , has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer .</seg>
<seg id=94>but the researchers say their results could merely be the result of chance , as other studies have suggested that folic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer , so they urge pregnant women to continue taking the supplement .</seg>
<seg id=95>folic acid , found naturally in dark , leafy vegetables , is known to be a key aid in the growth of the fetus .</seg>
<seg id=96>researchers from the universities of bristol and aberdeen followed 3,000 women who in the 1960s were given supplements of either five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folate , or a placebo , mostly during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy .</seg>
<seg id=97>the study published in the british medical journal says that by september 2002 , breast cancer rates were twice as high for those who took the five - milligram supplement as for those who took the placebo .</seg>
<seg id=98>one of the researchers , ness , has stressed the results were merely " preliminary intended to point the way towards further research " .</seg>
<seg id=99>" it 's entirely possible that this is a chance finding , so further scientific studies are required to examine the association , if there is one , before we reach any conclusions , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=100>ness says women planning to become pregnant should still take folic acid supplements .</seg>
<seg id=101>he says there is a " considerable difference between the trial " and current dosage recommendations .</seg>
<seg id=102>according to british health guidelines , women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first trimester of their pregnancy should take a 0.4 - microgram daily supplement of folic acid c more than 10 times smaller than the doses given to women in the study .</seg>
<seg id=103>two candidates in widely different mood as ukraine holds presidential re-election</seg>
<seg id=104>the two rivals set to meet in ukraine 's presidential re-election on the 26th this month have got ready for the runoff .</seg>
<seg id=105>the pro-west opposition leader yushchenko is confident of wining the election while the pro-moscow incumbent prime minister yanukovych says he will no longer represent the " shameful " ruling party in the election .</seg>
<seg id=106>meanwhile , russian president putin has changed his attitude towards ukraine 's entry into the european union , saying he supports its entry into the eu .</seg>
<seg id=107>asked how many votes he would garner in the re-election , yushchenko told a crowded press conference , " conservatively speaking , i should win around 60% of the votes . "</seg>
<seg id=108>on the other hand , yanukovych , looking anxious and upset from his appearance , directly dodged answering reporters ' questions several times , saying at last , " for god 's will , we will win . "</seg>
<seg id=109>yanukovych , who was originally chosen as a successor of incumbent president kuchma , has changed his mind and positioned himself as a rival candidate against both the opposition and the ruling parties .</seg>
<seg id=110>" i used to trust those cowards and traitors working with the government but i 'm very disappointed now . the government is shameful , " he said almost directly giving the names .</seg>
<seg id=111>kuchma and the opposition reached a compromise to transfer part of the presidential powers to the parliament by amending the law to end two weeks of massive opposition protests and political chaos since the presidential election on november 21st .</seg>
<seg id=112>yanukovych 's victory in the election has been declared invalid by the supreme court by reason of massive electoral frauds and a re-election must be held .</seg>
<seg id=113>powell visits hague in final push for eu - us harmony in his term</seg>
<seg id=114>us secretary of state powell today held talks with senior officials of the european union to make one last effort to push forward us - eu unity in his term .</seg>
<seg id=115>powell 's european tour is aimed at mending the diplomatic impairment between the two sides that has resulted from the iraqi war . hague is his last stop .</seg>
<seg id=116>it will likely be powell 's last official overseas trip in his term . the eu has promised him they will continue working to ease strained bilateral ties ahead of us president bush 's february visit to europe .</seg>
<seg id=117>however , differences between the two sides still linger .</seg>
<seg id=118>" we have to intensify the dialogue and rediscover some common ground during the second term of president bush , " said dutch foreign minister bot , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .</seg>
<seg id=119>eu external relations commissioner ms . waldner says she believes europe and the united states have already made progress " to put the difficult moments of the iraq crisis behind us " , but she still acknowledges that it is a " key moment in the eu - us relationship " now .</seg>
<seg id=120>bush will fly to brussels on february 22nd to meet with eu and nato leaders .</seg>
<seg id=121>powell says bush 's visit is aimed at mending the fissures caused by the iraq issue .</seg>
<seg id=122>powell has visited sofia and brussels during this european trip but has only made limited progress in improving ties .</seg>
<seg id=123>in brussels in particular , powell criticized six anti-war european nato members for hurting the " credibility and cohesion " of the alliance by refusing to attend the training exercises in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=124>however , powell still firmly holds that his meetings have shown the us 's commitment towards fully restoring diplomatic relations .</seg>
<seg id=125>basescu elected romanian president , faces challenge of forming government</seg>
<seg id=126>romania 's opposition candidate basescu won a fierce presidential election today but the center - right mayor of bucharest is likely to face big challenges when forming a new government due to the large number of parties in a split parliament .</seg>
<seg id=127>according to the final official results announced today by romania 's central election commission , basescu , candidate of the " justice and truth alliance " , had won 51.23% of the votes while his rival ; prime minister nastase had won 48.77%.</seg>
<seg id=128>nastase has conceded the defeat and expressed his congratulations to basescu .</seg>
<seg id=129>outgoing president iliescu has also congratulated basescu .</seg>
<seg id=130>nastase says his social democratic party will help basescu to enable romania 's smooth entry into the european union .</seg>
<seg id=131>the social democratic party won a victory in the parliamentary election of the 28th last month .</seg>
<seg id=132>" today my priority is to form , as soon as possible , a government capable of continuing membership negotiations for romania to join the european union . romania must make efforts to satisfy the demands for the eu entry , " basescu said in a press conference .</seg>
<seg id=133>he stressed that the romanian people should know what cost would be paid for the integration . the nation must be united to ensure that there would not be voices suspecting the integration .</seg>
<seg id=134>romania has completed negotiations on the eu entry and is expected to join the bloc in january of 2007 .</seg>
<seg id=135>basescu has also put the fight against poverty and corruption and ensuring legal independence as his priorities .</seg>
<seg id=136>dispute over past work remains ; oliver stone seeks peace with turkey</seg>
<seg id=137>movie director oliver stone is in istanbul today promoting the new film " alexander " and hoping to repair an old rift with turkey .</seg>
<seg id=138>his screenplay for the classic " midnight express " has been criticized for tarnishing the image of turkey .</seg>
<seg id=139>" i never intended it to be against turkey . it was against injustice everywhere , " he told afp in an exclusive interview .</seg>
<seg id=140>public opinion in turkey has denounced stone since the first screening of the award - winning film in 1978 .</seg>
<seg id=141>the film was based on the memoirs of billy hayes .</seg>
<seg id=142>hayes , a young american , was sentenced to 30 years in jail in turkey after a protracted legal saga that began when he was caught at istanbul airport trying to smuggle hashish out of the country .</seg>
<seg id=143>critics in turkey have accused stone of willfully interpolating hayes ' original book and writing a racist screenplay in which every turkish character , without exception , is depicted as a villain .</seg>
<seg id=144>the film is also rife with horrific prison scenes of rape and torture .</seg>
<seg id=145>stone has acknowledged that " perhaps some of the zealousness , some of the anger came from being young and trying to make the point too much , too hard " .</seg>
<seg id=146>but he added , " it was true that hayes did get screwed in the turkish prison . he was convicted for relatively nothing to 30 years and he was treated brutally in prison . so this is all documented . "</seg>
<seg id=147>" the larger picture is that turkey is not the only country whose prison system is not working properly . america has similar problems , " stone said .</seg>
<seg id=148>japan 's economic growth likely to slow down next year</seg>
<seg id=149>japan 's economy may be heading towards a slowdown in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing disparity between rich and poor threaten to spoil the harmonious atmosphere enjoyed in the early part of this year .</seg>
<seg id=150>while huge corporate profits and stronger consumer spending brought confidence back to japan this year after a decade of stagnation , analysts now pin their hopes on a booming china to sustain economic growth despite growing political tensions between japan and china .</seg>
<seg id=151>the evidence is mounting that japan 's economy could slump briefly in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid a glut .</seg>
<seg id=152>under a recently adopted new data methodology , japan 's economy actually contracted slightly in the april - june quarter and grew only 0.1% in the july - september quarter , narrowly avoiding a technical recession .</seg>
<seg id=153>at present , economists still differ in their views about the robustness of japan 's economic recovery .</seg>
<seg id=154>according to estimates by bnp paribas researchers , japan 's economy will record a 2.3% growth in real terms for both the current fiscal year ending in march next year and the fiscal year that follows .</seg>
<seg id=155>they call 2005 " the year of recovery " on the grounds that the us economy is firmly on a recovery track and japanese consumer spending is taking up the slack for slower exports .</seg>
<seg id=156>another relatively pessimistic view is from ufj institute economists who expect only 1.8% growth in the current fiscal year and an even slower 0.6% for the following fiscal year .</seg>
<seg id=157>they have cited the " potential risk " that corporate profits have failed to lead to higher personal incomes .</seg>
<seg id=158>french foreign minister : middle east peace process to test french - us ties</seg>
<seg id=159>after a meeting with us secretary of state powell today , french foreign minister barnier said that resuming middle east peace talks would be a " test " of their trans - atlantic relationship .</seg>
<seg id=160>following the death of palestinian leader arafat , france called for the rapid convening of an international conference to push forward the israeli - palestinian peace process but there was no sign of agreement between barnier and powell after their meeting .</seg>
<seg id=161>barnier flew into washington from paris for a lightning round of talks with powell and his designated successor , national security adviser rice , before turning around and heading to brussels for a european union summit .</seg>
<seg id=162>both paris and washington have agreed to repair relations strained by the us invasion of iraq last year , but differences remain clear over how to best resolve the middle east impasse .</seg>
<seg id=163>" we want to improve future relations between france and america and europe and america , " said barnier , after a short meeting with us secretary of state powell .</seg>
<seg id=164>" i think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to launch the peace process between palestinians and israelis , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=165>barnier called early this week for an early international conference on the middle east to take advantage of what he termed a " window of opportunity " created after arafat 's death last month .</seg>
<seg id=166>but powell has not made any promise .</seg>
<seg id=167>he said the two had spoken of a british plan to hold a meeting bringing in the palestinians but did not mention if a broader international meeting would be held .</seg>
<seg id=168>us officials say they have made it their priority to promote the israeli - palestinian peace to ensure smooth palestinian elections next month .</seg>
<seg id=169>the election will produce a leader who could rein in islamic militants and resume talks with israel .</seg>
<seg id=170>foreign minister machimura proposes japan - south korea talks for next january</seg>
<seg id=171>japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura proposed today that japan and south korea hold talks on a free trade agreement ( fta ) as early as january next year .</seg>
<seg id=172>jiji press reports that during a meeting with the south korean foreign and commercial minister , ban ki - moon , in the southern japanese city of ibusuki in kagoshima county , machimura said the two sides should resume talks as soon as possible , since both tokyo and seoul wish to conclude the fta by the end of 2005 .</seg>
<seg id=173>the talks between machimura and ban ki - moon followed the summit of the 17th between japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and south korean president roh moo - hyun , who urged tokyo to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions against north korea .</seg>
<seg id=174>prime minister koizumi is under great public pressure to punish north korea over its abductions of many japanese nationals during the cold war .</seg>
<seg id=175>the families of kidnapping victims were outraged after japanese researchers concluded last week that pyongyang presented the remains of other people in a bid to prove that two kidnapped victims were dead .</seg>
<seg id=176>apart from the abduction issue , koizumi and roh moo - hyun mutually agreed that the six - nation talks aimed at halting north korea 's nuclear weapons development should resume as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=177>since a standoff starting in october 2002 resulted from north korea 's secret development of a nuclear weapons project , three rounds of six - party talks have taken place and ended without concrete results .</seg>
<seg id=178>north korea has boycotted the fourth round of six - party talks scheduled for september this year .</seg>
<seg id=179>members of the six - party talks include south korea , north korea , the united states , china , japan and russia .</seg>
<seg id=180>thai prime minister thaksin still expected to win next february 's election</seg>
<seg id=181>thai prime minister thaksin is confident he will win a second four - year term heading into 2005 but his reputation has been tarnished by a failure to quell a deadly separatist insurgency .</seg>
<seg id=182>with national elections slated for february 6 next year , thaksin and his political adversaries are gearing up for a battle which most analysts expect him to win despite the serious violence and bird flu epidemic in the south this year .</seg>
<seg id=183>a total of 12 people died this year from bird flu in thailand . the bird flu swept across much of asia but was particularly devastating in thailand , where the government admitted it had " made mistakes " in its handling of the epidemic .</seg>
<seg id=184>however , the health concern is unlikely to unseat thaksin . instead , many are asking only how thorough his victory will be , and what will it mean for the muslim insurgency in the southern provinces .</seg>
<seg id=185>" the phenomenon here is that no matter how one looks at thaksin , he has managed to capture popularity for the time being , " kraisak , chairman of the senate 's committee on foreign affairs told the afp .</seg>
<seg id=186>" but things will start to disintegrate next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and associates ) , the social injustices and the violence , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=187>it is because of social injustices and violence that chaos erupted in thailand 's muslim - majority deep south , where a sporadic separatist insurgency occurred continuously starting in january .</seg>
<seg id=188>since january this year , radical muslims have targeted buddhists , government officials and security forces in shootings . they also carried out bombing attacks and beheadings . more than 560 people have been killed and another 100 are reported missing so far .</seg>
<seg id=189>palestinian cabinet secretary claims arafat poisoned about one year ago</seg>
<seg id=190>late palestinian leader arafat 's cabinet secretary abdelrahman reveals that arafat may have been poisoned one year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his ramallah headquarters .</seg>
<seg id=191>" something strange happened to arafat around a year ago . it was on september 25 , 2003 , " abdelrahman told al - hayat newspaper .</seg>
<seg id=192>" the president shook hands with around 30 supporters before leaving to vomit .</seg>
<seg id=193>it was from that moment that the president 's health started slowly deteriorating . "</seg>
<seg id=194>arafat died in a french hospital of an unknown illness on november 11 .</seg>
<seg id=195>some senior palestinian officials have suggested the veteran leader had been poisoned .</seg>
<seg id=196>however , french doctors have insisted there was no medical basis for such allegations .</seg>
<seg id=197>two weeks before the delegation 's call on arafat mentioned by abdelrahman , the israeli prime minister sharon 's cabinet had just taken a decision to remove arafat , although without specifying by what means .</seg>
<seg id=198>the israeli threat had prompted expressions of support for arafat , who thereafter received the visit of several delegations of supporters .</seg>
<seg id=199>" arafat shook hands with people , who had come to express solidarity with him in his confinement by israel , " abdelrahman recalled .</seg>
<seg id=200>on september 25th last year , arafat received two delegations , one group of cyclists from around the world on a peace mission and another group of political activists .</seg>
<seg id=201>" the last time arafat became ill , on october 12 this year , he had the same symptoms : vomiting , refusal to eat and all the symptoms of a flu , " abdelrahman pointed out .</seg>
<seg id=202>bush recognizes iraqi troop training needs to be improved and fully supports rumsfeld</seg>
<seg id=203>us president bush admitted today that the iraqi army was not ready to replace us troops , and warned that the election scheduled to be held on january 30th next year would not be an end to serious violence in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=204>during a one - hour press conference , bush also expressed his support for defense secretary rumsfeld , firmly believing that the pentagon chief would " fulfill his duty " .</seg>
<seg id=205>bush says that despite some occasional serious differences , he has pledged to continue cooperation with russian president putin , adding that it is the right time to move on a road leading to the end of conflict in the middle east .</seg>
<seg id=206>he also believes that the best way to deal with the issues of iraq and north korea , existing members of the " axis of evil " , is through multilateral diplomatic mediation .</seg>
<seg id=207>continuous car bombing attacks yesterday shocked the iraqi shiite muslim 's two holy cities of najaf and kabala , killing 66 people and injuring more than 200 others . bush has recognized that violence has made the iraqis pay a price but insists that the election in january will go ahead .</seg>
<seg id=208>bush has warned the americans that the iraqi election " is only the beginning of the political process " . he also warns " we certainly do n't expect a smooth process . "</seg>
<seg id=209>bush has also admitted that the training results of iraqi security forces are a mixed bag .</seg>
<seg id=210>" sometimes , when there is fierce fighting , they ( iraqi troops ) will run away , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=211>he says such iraqi troops can never protect the national security , which is unacceptable .</seg>

<seg id=214>in response to rebels ' attack at noon today on a restaurant in a us military base in iraq 's major northern city of mosul , which has killed 22 and wounded over 60 others , white house spokesman mcclellan said that as the iraqi election is coming nearer , terrorist activities by iraqi rebels will become more rampant but such " enemies of freedom " will surely be eliminated .</seg>
<seg id=215>reports from iraq say that a large explosion occurred in a military base restaurant during lunchtime causing heavy casualties among the us soldiers .</seg>
<seg id=216>the iraqi interim government is scheduled to hold the first election since the overthrow of the hussein regime on january 30th .</seg>
<seg id=217>the united states has dispatched nearly 20,000 more troops to ensure the security of the iraqi election .</seg>
<seg id=218>the total number of us troops during the election will reach 150,000 .</seg>
<seg id=219>mcclellan says the nearer the election is , the more terrorist attacks rebels loyal to hussein will launch in an attempt to undermine the interim government . they want to turn back to the past but " they will be defeated and they are being defeated " .</seg>
<seg id=220>as for a recent poll that shows about 56% of the american people believing the war in iraq is " not worth fighting " , 57% disapproving of bush 's handling of the iraq situation and 52% believing defense secretary rumsfeld should resign , mcclellan says president bush has never been one to govern based on polls .</seg>
<seg id=221>" polls are snapshots in time , and we are working to continue to build upon the progress being made in iraq . "</seg>

<seg id=226>many riot police were deployed near malacanang palace because of concern that poe 's supporters could erupt into violence .</seg>
<seg id=227>these people have accused president arroyo of rigging the presidential election on may 10th .</seg>

<seg id=237>us deputy secretary of state armitage warned syria today , saying the development of future ties between damascus and washington rests on whether syria is willing to cooperate with the us on the issues of iraq and lebanon .</seg>

<seg id=269>russian president putin pointed out today that russia 's takeover of the major assets of russian oil giant yukos was to protect the national interest . it was also the first move of re-nationalization in the post soviet era .</seg>

<seg id=355>powell predicts shiite victory in iraqi election</seg>
<seg id=356>us secretary of state colin powell today predicted a shiite victory in the iraqi elections but he also assuaged concerns it could bolster iranian influence inside the country because of the past feud between iraqi and iranian shias .</seg>
<seg id=357>there are growing indications that sunni arabs will either boycott the january 30th election or will be prevented from taking part in it by the iraqi authority due to a spreading insurgency .</seg>
<seg id=358>" the new government and the transitional national assembly that will come into place will be majority shiite , " said powell on nbc 's " meet the press " .</seg>
<seg id=359>" the majority of the iraqi population is also shiite . "</seg>
<seg id=360>shiite muslims make up more than 60% of iraq 's population , and are concentrated mostly in the southern and central parts of the country .</seg>
<seg id=361>sunni arabs , who live in central and western provinces , comprise about 20% of all iraqis .</seg>
<seg id=362>former iraqi foreign minister pachachi , who now heads the sunni - dominated iraqi independent democrats party , today called for the vote to be delayed but powell said the iraqi election would be held on schedule .</seg>
<seg id=363>powell also said he felt it was unlikely shiite control of iraq 's future government would mean it would be run from iran .</seg>
<seg id=364>" my sensing right now is that , even though there may be iranian influence - and iranians will try to influence iraq 's political situation , but there is sufficient difference and past serious disagreements and conflicts between iranian and iraqi shias , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=365>international aid pours in but time not on tsunami victims ' side</seg>
<seg id=366>foreign rescue troops are airdropping food and setting up clean water supplies in asia 's tsunami - hit areas to help millions of victims left homeless and hungry .</seg>
<seg id=367>statistics show the death toll has reached nearly 150,000 .</seg>
<seg id=368>donations are flooding in from various governments while us president bush has put his father , george bush , and his predecessor , clinton , in charge of efforts to raise private aid .</seg>
<seg id=369>a us delegation led by secretary of state powell arrived in thailand last night to express us concern and assess the progress of the relief work ahead of a crisis summit on the 6th in the indonesian capital of jakarta .</seg>
<seg id=370>powell 's delegation includes president bush 's younger brother , florida governor jeb bush , and us agency for international development administrator natsios .</seg>
<seg id=371>powell will head the delegation to inspect the disaster in thailand , indonesia and sri lanka before attending the summit on the 6th .</seg>
<seg id=372>powell said the mission of the visit was to assess the situation " and see what else the us might need to do " , but he was carrying no new immediate promise of aid beyond the 350 million dollars already committed .</seg>
<seg id=373>since the disaster occurred , there is a voice now to give up the search for thousands of tourists still unaccounted for , many of them foreign tourists .</seg>
<seg id=374>however , thai prime minister thaksin has vowed that the hunt will go on in his country .</seg>
<seg id=375>" we will continue to use our best efforts as foreign experts have told me that they ( the missing ) may have been buried in mud in mangrove forests . so we will not stop searching , " thaksin told reporters in phuket island .</seg>

<seg id=379>tsunami relief efforts mask backstage political wrestling</seg>
<seg id=380>with asian tsunami relief materials flooding into disaster - hit areas , behind - the - scene activities are also underway with governments wrestling over who should offer and receive the aid and who should play a leading role in the largest relief operation in modern history .</seg>
<seg id=381>the tragedy , which has killed nearly 150,000 people , has rekindled past flames of war , including the differences between the united states , the united nations and europe as well as the struggle for the leading role in asia .</seg>
<seg id=382>however , relief experts still hold cautious hopes that given the many countries that have been hit by the tsunami , the tragedy on a global scale may set a precedent for countries that have promised aid to indeed keep their commitments .</seg>
<seg id=383>" aid commitments by governments have never been 100% fulfilled in time , " said international development professor juma of harvard university 's kennedy school of government .</seg>
<seg id=384>governments have already pledged aid of us $2 billion . prominent figures in the international political arena including us secretary of state powell and un secretary general annan as well as the leaders of australia , china and japan will hold a crisis summit with deep political implications on the 6th in the indonesian capital of jakarta .</seg>
<seg id=385>us president bush increased us aid nearly ten - fold to us $350 million after being accused of being slow in response and following senior un relief official egeland 's open criticism of rich countries ' " stinginess " .</seg>

<seg id=413>annan 's plan to visit rebel controlled regions in sri lanka blocked</seg>
<seg id=414>un secretary general annan said today he wanted to return to sri lanka someday to " see all parts of the country " .</seg>
<seg id=415>annan ended a two - day tour of tsunami - battered parts of sri lanka amid reports the sri lankan government had blocked him from visiting rebel - held northern areas .</seg>
<seg id=416>asked at a press conference whether the sri lankan government had blocked him from traveling to zones held by the rebel liberation tigers of tamil eelam ( ltte ) , as widely reported in several national newspapers , annan said , " i 'm hoping to come back and see all parts of the country and be of help to accelerate the peace process . "</seg>
<seg id=417>annan said president kumaratunga had personally objected to his on - site visit in guerrilla - held territory , fearing the rebels would make political capital out of his visit .</seg>
<seg id=418>" i raised the question of the peace process and the need to intensify the peace efforts , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=419>" i have also discussed that with president kumaratunga . "</seg>
<seg id=420>the abandoned visit of annan to rebel - held regions has resulted in the indignation of residents of the rebel - controlled northern city of jaffna . hundreds of people staged a protest outside the un office in jaffna .</seg>
<seg id=421>however , the sri lankan government has firmly rejected the media reports , saying they are " misleading . "</seg>

<seg id=423>russian space agency denies rocket fuel causes sickness among children</seg>
<seg id=424>the british weekly science journal nature reports that highly toxic rocket fuel , spewed out during launches of spacecrafts at russia 's space base in baikonur , kazakhstan , is causing serious illness among children living nearby . but the russian space agency has denied the claim today .</seg>
<seg id=425>the science journal nature report published today quotes a study as saying that levels of endocrine disease and blood disorders among residents in the polluted areas are twice the regional average .</seg>
<seg id=426>the study was conducted by a team of russian scientists led by epidemiologist zykov .</seg>
<seg id=427>the russian space agency responded by saying that " no direct influence of space - related activities on the population 's health has so far been established " .</seg>
<seg id=428>the study quoted by nature focused on children in the altai republic .</seg>
<seg id=429>the altai republic is located in a mountainous region on the southern fringes of siberia .</seg>
<seg id=430>the altai republic was chosen as the study 's target because of pollution from unburned fuel , notably hydrazine .</seg>
<seg id=431>hydrazine is used to power the early stages of some russian launchers .</seg>
<seg id=432>zykov compared the health records of about 1,000 children in two polluted areas between 1998 and 2000 with health records of 3,300 children from a nearby unpolluted control group .</seg>
<seg id=433>nature reports zykov has concluded that children in the currently worst - affected areas are up to twice as likely to need medical attention during this time , and need to be treated twice as long .</seg>

<seg id=448>the us trade deficit is still growing despite a weakening dollar , which has made us goods cheaper at home and abroad .</seg>
<seg id=449>today 's report from the commerce department will put pressure on the dollar and renew calls for washington to do something about us energy independence and the trade imbalance between the us and china .</seg>
<seg id=450>the decline of us exports last november was caused by a us $1.4 - billion drop in capital goods , including us $325 million in aircraft and aircraft engines .</seg>

<seg id=453>japanese defense chief : never forget militaristic history , respect neighboring nations ' dignity</seg>
<seg id=454>the director general of japan 's defense agency , yoshinori ono , said today that even with japan 's high profile in the world , it would not forget its militarist history and would keep in mind neighboring asian countries ' " dignity " .</seg>
<seg id=455>asked about concerns likely to rise upon japan sending its self defense forces ( sdf ) to the tsunami - hit areas of south asia , ono said , " when we have contacts with southeast asian countries , we should never forget the past . "</seg>
<seg id=456>he told reporters , " we must establish a kind of relationship whereby we can tell our friendly neighbors that we are friendly .</seg>
<seg id=457>when looking back at the past , we should fully respect other countries ' dignity . "</seg>
<seg id=458>ono specifically talked about this year as marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war . " we hope we can be reborn and cooperate with the new era , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=459>ono has just concluded a tour of several tsunami - hit south asian countries . he said that when the indonesian leader told him that the relief operation by japan 's sdf should come to an end no later than the end of march , he felt the " dignity " of an independent nation .</seg>
<seg id=460>the un has expressed its concern over the time limit for foreign troops set by the indonesian government .</seg>
<seg id=461>foreign troops have been widely praised for offering aid to the most remote tsunami survivors .</seg>
<seg id=462>nearly 1,000 japanese sdf soldiers are heading to countries that were hit by the tsunami on december 26th . the death toll of the disaster has exceeded 163,000 .</seg>
<seg id=463>this is the largest deployment operation of japan 's sdf since the end of the second world war .</seg>
<seg id=464>japan 's constitution imposed by the united states after the war renounces the use of force by the sdf .</seg>
<seg id=465>political interference in nhk program ? war of words erupts in japanese media</seg>
<seg id=466>allegations that the public - owned japan broadcasting corp . ( nhk ) had been pressured by politicians several years ago to soft - pedal a program on japan 's legacy of sexual enslavement during world war ii have pitted liberal japanese media against their conservative counterparts .</seg>
<seg id=467>liberal japanese media have attacked nhk for leaving out large portions of interviews it had conducted with mostly critics of japan 's wartime conduct and victims of sex slavery , allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders .</seg>
<seg id=468>but conservative newspapers have defended nhk 's editing of the program , saying that nhk executives have a duty to ensure the fairness and objectiveness of their programs .</seg>
<seg id=469>the controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on sex slavery of comfort women in the japanese military during the war .</seg>
<seg id=470>the trial , held by a women 's rights group in tokyo in december 2000 , found the late emperor hirohito guilty of allowing the slavery of comfort women during japan 's occupation of asian nations .</seg>
<seg id=471>historians say at least 200,000 young women , mostly korean but also from taiwan , china , the philippines and indonesia , were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline japanese army brothels during the war .</seg>
<seg id=472>the program 's chief producer satoru nagai held a tearful news conference on the 13th noting that just before the program was to be aired senior nhk officials had met with lawmakers of the ruling liberal democratic party , shinzo abe and shoichi nakagawa , who expressed concerns over the program .</seg>
<seg id=473>nagai said top nhk officials then re-edited and shortened the program .</seg>
<seg id=474>" nhk bowed to political pressure , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=475>abe and nakagawa admitted meeting with nhk officials and telling them to be " fair " but strongly denied pressuring the broadcaster .</seg>
<seg id=476>eurozone indicators show core inflation under control</seg>
<seg id=477>economists said today that eurozone indicators to be released this week would show that core inflation still remains under control .</seg>
<seg id=478>meanwhile , eurozone industrial output and french consumer spending are both expected to decline .</seg>
<seg id=479>when the european union 's statistics service releases inflation figures on the 20th this month , they are expected to confirm that inflation will rise slightly to 2.3% in december from 2.2% in november .</seg>
<seg id=480>but the increase is largely a reflection of tobacco tax increases , and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9%.</seg>
<seg id=481>core inflation figures will be released together with the consumer prices figures .</seg>
<seg id=482>economists point out that core inflation , which excludes food , energy , tobacco and alcohol prices , has remained at a 1.6-2% range for the past two years .</seg>
<seg id=483>european central bank president trichet said on the 13th that short - term price pressures have diminished recently .</seg>
<seg id=484>while inflation will remain above 2% in the coming months , it is likely to fall below this level by the end of the year .</seg>
<seg id=485>meanwhile , another economist says a weak number is expected to be released for the eurozone 's november industrial output on the 18th , given recent evidence of weak growth in germany .</seg>
<seg id=486>german output declined 1.7% in november and economists polled by afp 's financial news subsidiary afx news expect eurozone output to fall 0.4% in november following the 0.5% drop recorded in october .</seg>
<seg id=487>schmieding of the bank of america says a rebound in eurozone output is likely in december .</seg>
<seg id=488>bureaucracy hits tsunami refugees twice</seg>
<seg id=489>three weeks after the strongest tsunami in history , surviving refugees are fighting with bureaucracy and political domination while the world 's attention has already been distracted to other places .</seg>
<seg id=490>with thousands of decaying corpses gradually unearthed from the rubble , the death toll of the december 26th tsunami disaster has exceeded 168,000 . meanwhile , the upcoming iraqi election and president bush 's inauguration will replace the tsunami disaster to become the world media 's headline news .</seg>
<seg id=491>indonesia has backtracked on a demand that foreign troops engaged in humanitarian relief operations will withdraw within 3 months .</seg>
<seg id=492>in thailand , leaders of canada , sweden , norway and finland are discussing the reconstruction project and efforts to identify the dead .</seg>
<seg id=493>however , survivors are facing new difficulties . for instance , the deep - rooted bureaucracy in indonesia has hindered the delivery of relief materials pouring in from around the world .</seg>
<seg id=494>" we are like persons who do not exist . we have been hit hard by the disaster , lost everything and are famished , " said busriadi , a fisherman from a little fishing village in aceh province 's capital , banda aceh , on indonesia 's sumatra island .</seg>
<seg id=495>he asked , " where are the food , clothes and other relief pouring into aceh as we have seen on television ? "</seg>
<seg id=496>busriadi , like thousands of other refugees , lost his identity cards and other official documents in the tsunami , making his quest for aid a nightmare .</seg>
<seg id=497>despite begging officials for help and daily hurrying back and forth going through formalities , the results have always been the same : no aid .</seg>
<seg id=498>zeng qinghong reportedly paid visit to zhao ziyang before the latter 's death</seg>
<seg id=499>the hong kong - based china information center for human rights and democracy says vice president zeng qinghong paid a visit to zhao ziyang , the purged former general secretary of the communist party of china ( cpc ) , before he died early this morning in a hospital .</seg>
<seg id=500>the information center has cited zhao ziyang 's family members as saying zeng qinghong visited him at 6:00 am in a beijing hospital , about one hour before he died at the age of 85 .</seg>
<seg id=501>zhao ziyang served as cpc general secretary and premier , but was ousted for opposing the use of military force to suppress the 1989 democratic movement at tiananmen square . he has since been under house arrest and regarded as an unpopular figure by the government .</seg>
<seg id=502>the information center has cited zhao 's family members as saying the incumbent premier wen jiabao , who used to work for zhao ziyang , had not paid a visit to him when he was seriously ill .</seg>
<seg id=503>however , before zhao ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th , tian jiyun , a retired member of the cpc central committee and his former assistant , visited him .</seg>
<seg id=504>the china information center for human rights and democracy has been in contact with zhao 's family and for years has been releasing accurate news about zhao ziyang at appropriate time .</seg>
<seg id=505>the information center said some 20 retired senior party , government and military officials planned to write an open letter to the cpc , calling for a reappraisal of zhao ziyang 's contributions and an open memorial service for him .</seg>
<seg id=506>the information center also said that zhao ziyang 's family will not be allowed to hold or prepare for a funeral , and relevant arrangements will be finally decided by the party .</seg>
<seg id=507>zhao ziyang 's wife , liang boqi , is 86 now .</seg>
<seg id=508>the information center said that due to concerns about her health , she had still not been informed about her husband 's death as of this evening .</seg>
<seg id=509>zhao ziyang passes away , china urged to move toward democratization</seg>
<seg id=510>after the former leader of the communist party of china ( cpc ) , zhao ziyang , died of illness today , world figures have highly praised him while japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , the taiwan government and overseas democratic movement activists have all called on beijing to carry out zhao ziyang 's ideas of democratic reform .</seg>
<seg id=511>zhao ziyang was dismissed from office for opposing the military suppression of the 1989 democracy movement at tiananmen square . he was put under house arrest and remained so until his death this morning at a beijing hospital at the age of 85 .</seg>
<seg id=512>jiji press reported japanese prime minister koizumi as saying , while mourning for zhao ziyang , that , " i hope they ( china ) are committed to democratization . </seg>
<seg id=513>taiwan has also appealed to china to carry out political and democratic reform after zhao ziyang 's death .</seg>
<seg id=514>chinese overseas democracy movement activists have praised zhao ziyang as " one of china 's greatest reformers " , who sacrificed his political life in order to oppose the bloody suppression of the democracy movement at tiananmen square .</seg>
<seg id=515>" during his suffering under house arrest for 15 years , he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress towards a government of law and democracy , " said lian shengde , once a student movement leader and now president of the new york - based free china movement .</seg>
<seg id=516>" zhao ziyang will be fondly remembered as a true democrat and a person of principle . "</seg>
<seg id=517>some democracy movement activists have requested the chinese government hold a public funeral for zhao ziyang and give fair appraisal to his achievements .</seg>
<seg id=518>however , they have acknowledged that zhao ziyang will not be offered such courteous service , as the chinese government fears that people who are disgruntled with the communist rule will make use of this opportunity to make disturbances .</seg>
<seg id=519>the 1989 student democratic movement was prompted just by the death of reformist party leader hu yaobang .</seg>
<seg id=520>xinhua news agency reported briefly today that comrade zhao ziyang died in beijing due to illness , which was the only official announcement on the matter .</seg>
<seg id=521>un : rich countries fail to fulfill commitment to reduce poor population</seg>
<seg id=522>a un appointed expert panel says in a new report that rich countries have so far failed to fulfill their commitments when they promised to offer aid to reduce half of the world 's extremely poor population by 2015 .</seg>
<seg id=523>the world 's rich countries had promised to take part in the ambitious un " new millennium development goal " program in order to improve the fate of the world 's poor and suffering .</seg>
<seg id=524>however , over 1 billion people in the world live on less than one us dollar and some 2.7 billion people live on less than two us dollars every day . un experts say there is almost no time left for rich countries to fulfill their commitments .</seg>
<seg id=525>" with the right mobilization of resources and political will , and reform in developing as well as in developed countries , these goals are still achievable , " said brown , head of the un development program .</seg>
<seg id=526>un experts say the world 's 22 rich nations have promised to offer 0.7% of their gross domestic product ( gdp ) to aid developing countries but they are now providing only 0.25%.</seg>
<seg id=527>un secretary general annan has commissioned former harvard economist sachs to lead a team of development experts to prepare this report on the progress of the goals , which includes extreme poverty elimination , achieving universal elementary education , child mortality reduction and the fight against aids and other deadly diseases .</seg>
<seg id=528>" in fact , the ways to practically resolve the problems already exist , the political structures have been set up and the costs are affordable for the first time . what is needed now is action , " the report says .</seg>

<seg id=530>the united nations has announced it will set up a global disaster warning system to predict large natural disasters .</seg>
<seg id=531>however , differences remain over which country 's technology will be used in the disaster warning system in the wake of the south asian tsunami tragedy .</seg>
<seg id=532>several un agencies said in a joint statement after a global conference in kobe , japan , that un experts would create a global disaster system to reduce the damage resulting from large natural disasters .</seg>
<seg id=533>the large disaster caused by the south asian tsunami has outraged indian ocean nations .</seg>

<seg id=535>" an effective early warning system can protect the lives and safety of millions of people around the world . "</seg>
<seg id=536>but the un statement is largely symbolic .</seg>

<seg id=563>( hong kong , macao and taiwan ) hong kong observatory offers new services to world meteorological organization 's websites</seg>
<seg id=564>xinhua news agency report of december 2nd from hong kong - starting on the 2nd , the hong kong observatory ( hko ) will offer two new services to the world meteorological organization 's websites , the " world weather information service " and the " severe weather information center " .</seg>
<seg id=565>a spokesman for the observatory says the two services will offer official weather observations of global cloud cover and rainfall to the " world weather information service " website and a 7 - day review of tropical cyclone movement to the " severe weather information center " website .</seg>
<seg id=566>the two services follow hko 's provision of official observation data on worldwide heavy rain ( including heavy snow ) which was offered to the " severe weather information center " website at the beginning of the year .</seg>
<seg id=567>sources say the " world weather information service " website has been offering official weather forecasts and monthly average climatological data for major cities around the world .</seg>
<seg id=568>the new service offers official weather observations around the world for the first time , with maps of global cloud cover and rainfall as its primary service items .</seg>
<seg id=569>the new web pages will cover a wide range of detailed weather observation data with 8 regular updates each day .</seg>
<seg id=570>the new product for the " severe weather information center " website is a review function of tropical cyclone movement routes .</seg>
<seg id=571>it was so designed originally that the website would not keep such information as a tropical cyclone 's previous locations after it had disappeared .</seg>
<seg id=572>however , it has often been the case that the public still want to obtain the relevant data about the tropical cyclone several days after its landing .</seg>
<seg id=573>to serve this purpose , the new product saves the tropical cyclone 's grades , locations and movement routes for the past 7 days so that the public and the media could still obtain needed data about a tropical cyclone several days after its landing and disappearance .</seg>
<seg id=574>world 's first bird flu virus h5n1 rapid diagnostic kits successfully developed in shantou</seg>

<seg id=584>the spokesman said the speech in hong kong on the 2nd by mr. hyde , chairman of the us house of representatives ' international relations committee , was a malicious attack on china 's development and progress as well as a slander on china 's foreign policy evidencing a cold war mentality , with which we are strongly unsatisfied .</seg>
<seg id=585>the spokesman noted that it is known to all the world that china 's development is not only in the fundamental interests of the 1.3 billion chinese people but also beneficial to the world 's prosperity and development .</seg>
<seg id=586>in the international political arena , china is a responsible country and has been playing an active and constructive role in safeguarding the world 's peace and stability .</seg>
<seg id=587>on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation , china has always strictly abided by relevant international conventions , firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form , and insisted on solving such issues through negotiations , talks and the strengthening of international supervision .</seg>
<seg id=588>the spokesman points out that it is regrettable that mr. hyde has turned a blind eye to the facts and made such extremely irresponsible remarks as sino - us relations are witnessing a healthy and stable development , which completely runs counter to the common grounds on the development of bilateral ties reached recently by heads of states of china and the us , goes against the mainstream voice in us asking to strengthen the cooperative relations with china , and is certainly harmful to the development of sino - us relations .</seg>
<seg id=589>china 's largest seawater desalination project to be kicked off in zhoushan</seg>
<seg id=590>xinhua news agency report of december 6th from hangzhou ( by pan yifeng and xu qun ) - china 's largest seawater desalination project in the mainland so far , with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons , is to be kicked off in the putuo district of zhoushan city in zhejiang province .</seg>
<seg id=591>for residents in zhoushan long accustomed to water shortages , the seawater surging beside them for hundreds of thousands of years will soon become clean and sweet tap water running into thousands of homes .</seg>
<seg id=592>according to relevant authorities , a cooperation agreement on a seawater desalination project with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons has recently been signed between the hangzhou development center of water treatment technology under the state oceanic administration and the liuheng township government of zhoushan city .</seg>
<seg id=593>the project costs 50 million yuan and has a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons of fresh water . it is presently the largest seawater desalination project in the mainland . the first - stage of construction is expected to be completed next year .</seg>
<seg id=594>zhoushan is one of chinese cities suffering from a serious water shortage .</seg>
<seg id=595>the entire city consists of 1,390 islands . the per capita fresh water is 601 cubic meters , which equals to only 25.4% of the per capita average in zhejiang province . the problem of drinking water shortages has long plagued residents of the island city .</seg>
<seg id=596>taking liuheng township in putuo district as an example , some 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be transported every day into the town from a neighboring one at a cost of over 10 yuan per ton .</seg>
<seg id=597>the technique of seawater desalination by reverse osmosis , developed by the hangzhou development center of water treatment technology under the state oceanic administration , is a process of membrane separation through the driving force of pressure , which at present is a focal point for current global seawater desalination research .</seg>
<seg id=598>according to the persons in charge from the center , both the cost and the energy consumption level of the seawater desalination by reverse osmosis project have been lowered through technological improvement and equipment modifications at home .</seg>
<seg id=599>the cost of seawater desalination per ton has further been lowered from the original 5 yuan .</seg>
<seg id=600>this indicates that the cost of seawater desalination is expected to approach that of tap water and industrial water .</seg>

<seg id=867>xinhua news agency report of december 30th from moscow ( by staff reporter song shiyi ) - the director of the russian presidential office and chairman of the russian natural gas industrial corporation ( gazprom ) , medvedev , told the press on the 30th that gazprom would merge the russian oil company ( rosneft ) as scheduled in january but yuganskneftegaz , the largest subsidiary company of the yukos oil company purchased by rosneft , would not be included in gazprom 's assets .</seg>
<seg id=868>in another report , when talking about the reason why auctioned assets of yuganskneftegaz would not be included in the assets of gazprom , russian industry and energy minister khristenko said it was because the nation had already been a majority share - holder of the russian oil and natural gas industrial corporation and the nation did n't want to increase its overwhelming share .</seg>
<seg id=869>he said yuganskneftegaz 's assets would be split off and transferred to a wholly state - owned company .</seg>
<seg id=870>on the 19th this month , the russian federal asset foundation held a public auction to sell 76.79% of the shares of yuganskneftegaz , yukos oil company 's largest subsidiary company . the newly formed baikal finance group won the bid with $9.35 billion .</seg>
<seg id=871>on the 22nd , the state - owned rosneft announced it had purchased baikal finance group , which won the bid for yuganskneftegaz 's shares , to become the new shareholder of yuganskneftegaz .</seg>
<seg id=872>analysts say one of the important reasons for russia 's maneuver of the auction of yuganskneftegaz 's assets is to position itself in a leading position in relevant legal disputes .</seg>
<seg id=873>in september this year , russian president putin approved gazprom 's merger of rosneft .</seg>
<seg id=874>gazprom was founded in february 1993 and is the world 's largest company in natural gas exploration .</seg>
<seg id=875>the company holds 65% of russia 's natural gas reserves .</seg>
<seg id=876>last year , the company 's gas output accounted for 93% of that in russia and 20% in the world .</seg>

<seg id=2>the marriage between bahraini princess meriam al - khalifa and johnson , a us marine , was once widely applauded as a beautiful story by us television stations . the star - crossed marriage , however , lasted only five years and has now come to an end in the desert casino city of las vegas .</seg>
<seg id=3>meriam is a member of the gulf state of bahrain 's royal family . johnson risked his military career for this forbidden love . their marriage , resembling a fairy tale , was once the theme of a tv drama .</seg>
<seg id=4>however , as reported by the las vegas review - journal , five years have scarcely passed when the two confronted each other in court as meriam filed with the court for divorce in las vegas , where quick marriages but even quicker divorces are granted .</seg>
<seg id=5>the pair met in 1999 when johnson was still a career military man stationed in bahrain .</seg>
<seg id=6>after he met this little princess who is still in her teens , both fell in love with each other , which changed his life tremendously .</seg>
<seg id=7>since their union was forbidden by the royal family , johnson disguised meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers , then sneaked her out of her motherland and brought her to the united states .</seg>
<seg id=8>after a bitter immigration lawsuit with us authorities , the young couple finally got married at the candlelight wedding chapel on the las vegas strip known for its dazzling grandeur when johnson was 23 and the bride was only 19 .</seg>
<seg id=9>however , johnson said that due to temptations in las vegas , otherwise known as a " sin city , " his constant tensions with meriam 's rich and powerful family , and rumors of an assassination plot at his life , this star - crossed marriage eventually failed to survive .</seg>
<seg id=10>johnson said he made a living by valet parking for guests of hotels and casinos , while meriam gradually indulged herself to the nightlife in the gambling city , frequenting nightclubs late at night without any regard to him as a husband .</seg>
<seg id=11>meriam deserted her husband a year ago .</seg>

<seg id=15>they said that economic output data from the largest country in eurozone will continue to show dramatic monthly fluctuations , but the long - term trend in economic output will show a slow - down of economic growth .</seg>
<seg id=16>the most important economic indicator this week will be in germany . the zew institute 's economic expectations index , closely watched by the market and scheduled to be released on the 7th , will provide the first proof of economic confidence in europe for december .</seg>
<seg id=17>the zew index dropped sharply to 13.9 in november from 31.3 in the previous month .</seg>
<seg id=18>economists said , as the significant appreciation of the euro will continue to impact the economic confidence in the recent survey , there is no reason to expect any rebound in economic expectations index .</seg>
<seg id=19>bnp economists said : " considering that major factors driving down economic confidence , including the appreciation of the euro , the uncertainty of global economy and the deteriorating employment rate in the job market in germany , are all burdens on the future growth expectations for the december survey period , a strong rebound in expectations index will be unlikely .

<seg id=25>western power has gradually penetrated into some corners of europe originally considered by russia as its backyard , such as the baltic states , georgia and central asia . this has long displeased russia . as a result , the recent incident in ukraine will likely become the major topic at the two - day osce meeting to be held in sofia , capital of bulgaria .</seg>
<seg id=26>the supreme court in ukraine has made a dramatic ruling , ordering a re-vote for the recent second round of the presidential run - off , while the european union earlier called on the osce member states to prepare for observers to act " with fastest speed and efficiency . "</seg>

<seg id=42>ukrainian pro-western opposition insisted today that the opposition will not accept the constitutional reform pushed forward by outgoing president kuchma before re-holding the second round of the presidential run - off .</seg>
<seg id=43>this constitutional reform will take away the majority of the current presidential power .</seg>
<seg id=44>after the supreme court annulled the november 21 election on the grounds that the second - round of election was riddled with fraud , and the central election commission ordered a repeat run - off on december 26 , the opposition leader yushchenko again found himself in a stand - off with kuchman .</seg>

<seg id=53>tens of thousands of yushchenko supporters have congregated in the capital kiev for two weeks . they blockaded the government buildings and camped on the main streets specifically designed by russian experts for military parade . the power of people they have demonstrated has forced the supreme court to annul the second round of the presidential election held on november 21 , the central election commission to order a repeat run - off on december 26 , and the parliament to approve firing yanukovych . however , kuchma has so far not signed the executive order to remove this successor whom he has nurtured all along .</seg>
<seg id=54>yushchenko told the supporting masses that gathered on the capital 's independence square tonight that kuchma should dismiss his government and reorganize the central election commission and that both the parliament and kuchma should agree to amend the electoral law so as to prevent election fraud .</seg>
<seg id=55>he said in this speech that kicks off the run - off on december 26: " there should be no talks on removing the blockade of government buildings or the presidential office before these decisions are made .</seg>

<seg id=70>the unicef annual report released today pointed out that more than one billion children , half of the world 's total , are brutally ravaged by poverty , war and aids .</seg>
<seg id=71>unicef said the rights of children to a healthy and protected upbringing , as clearly laid out in the 1989 convention on the rights of the child , were often imperiled , due in part to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms .</seg>
<seg id=72>ms . bellamy , the unicef executive director , pointed out at the annual report launch in london , " when half of the world 's children are growing up in hunger and in unhealthy environment , when schools have become targets of attacks and entire villages are destroyed by aids , we have failed to deliver our promise to children . "</seg>
<seg id=73>bellamy added : " too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually harm children . "</seg>
<seg id=74>the statistical data jointly compiled by unicef and researchers from britain 's london school of economics and bristol university revealed a horrific picture of children at risk in most part of the world .</seg>

<seg id=85>the european union said in a joint statement issued after its summit meeting with china 's premier wen jiabao : " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work toward lifting the embargo . "</seg>
<seg id=86>the statement said the chinese delegation " welcomed this positive signal and believed this signal will benefit the healthy development of the broad strategic partnership between china and the european union . "</seg>
<seg id=87>wen jiabao made no effort to hide his displeasure in a press conference after the summit and said this embargo " does not reflect the partnership between china and the european union . "</seg>
<seg id=88>wen jiabao said : " this embargo was a result of the cold war . it cannot reflect the current situation , nor can it reflect the partnership between china and the european union . "</seg>
<seg id=89>led by france , some eu countries are working to have this arms embargo lifted , claiming this embargo is already out of date .</seg>
<seg id=90>without adding any amendment to strengthen the related eu laws , some wise eu officials are worried that lifting the embargo may open the floodgates to arms sales and help enhance china 's military capabilities .</seg>
<seg id=91>dutch prime minister balkenende said : " i have explained that the european union has the wish to lift the embargo , but i have also made it clear that lifting the ban is closely connected with making adjustment to the code of conduct on arms exports . "</seg>
<seg id=92>preliminary study yields inconclusive finding that folic acid may lead to breast cancer</seg>
<seg id=93>a latest health study pointed out that " folic acid , " a b vitamin widely taken by pregnant women to prevent birth defects , may increase the risk of getting breast cancer .</seg>
<seg id=94>however , researchers said the result of their study may be merely the result of chance because other studies show folic acid can actually reduce the risk of breast cancer . therefore , they urged pregnant women to continue taking this supplement .</seg>
<seg id=95>folic acid , found naturally in dark - color leafy vegetables , is known in the medical community to provide a key aid in the growth of a fetus .</seg>
<seg id=96>researchers from the two universities of bristol and aberdeen in britain kept track of 3,000 women who , in the 1960s , either took five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folic acid or a placebo mostly during the second and third trimester of their pregnancy .</seg>
<seg id=97>the report carried in the british medical journal said that by september 2002 breast cancer rates for the women who took five milligrams of folic acid turned out to be twice as high as for those who merely took the placebo .</seg>
<seg id=98>ness , one of the researchers , stressed that this result was only " preliminary ... intended to point toward the way toward further research . "</seg>
<seg id=99>he said : " it is entirely possible that this is a chance result . so further scientific studies are required to examine the association if such an association exists before we reach any conclusion . "</seg>
<seg id=100>ness said women who are planning to become pregnant should still take the supplement of folic acid .</seg>
<seg id=101>he said " there is a considerable difference between the trial dosage " and the current suggested dosage .</seg>
<seg id=102>according to the british health guidelines , women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first trimester of their pregnancy should take a daily dose of 0.4 milligrams of folic acid , more than 10 times smaller than the dose taken by the women in the study .</seg>
<seg id=103>two candidates of two entirely different moods in ukraine 's presidential re-run</seg>
<seg id=104>the two opponents confronting each other in ukraine 's presidential re-run on the 26th of this month have now readied themselves for a decisive battle .</seg>
<seg id=105>pro-western opposition leader yushchenko is confident of winning the election , while pro-moscow incumbent prime minister yanukovych says he will no longer run on behalf of the " shameful " ruling party .</seg>
<seg id=106>in the meantime , russia 's president putin changed his stance toward ukraine 's eu accession , saying he would be happy to see ukraine join the european union .</seg>
<seg id=107>asked what percentage of the vote he is expecting to get in the re-run , yushchenko said to reporters who packed the conference room : " to be conservative , i should be able to get about 60%. "</seg>
<seg id=108>on the other hand , yanukovych , anxiety written all over his face , evaded directly answering reporters ' questions several times and finally said simply : " by god 's will , we will win . "</seg>
<seg id=109>yanukovych , originally trained by current president kuchma as his successor , has now made a departure , positioning himself as a candidate against both the opposition and ruling parties .</seg>
<seg id=110>he said , in a manner bordering on name - calling : " i used to trust those cowards and traitors working for the government . now i feel nothing but great disappointment . this government is indeed a shame . "</seg>
<seg id=111>in an exchange of conditions with the opposition party , kuchma tried to amend laws in order to transfer some presidential power to the parliament so as to end massive opposition protests and political turmoil that have gone on for two weeks since the november 21 presidential runoff .</seg>
<seg id=112>the original winner yanukovych has also had his election invalidated by the supreme court due to the fraud - riddled voting process and must go through a re-election .</seg>
<seg id=113>powell visits hague to offer his final efforts at us - eu harmony during his term</seg>
<seg id=114>us secretary of state powell today held a meeting with top eu officials to offer his final efforts at us - eu solidarity during his term .</seg>
<seg id=115>the purpose of this european visit by powell was to repair diplomatic damage on both sides due to the iraq war . the hague was his last stop .</seg>
<seg id=116>the trip may be powell 's last official visit abroad during his term . the european union promised him that it will work toward easing tensions between the two sides before us president bush 's visit to europe next february .</seg>
<seg id=117>however , differences between the two sides still linger .</seg>
<seg id=118>foreign minister bot of the netherlands , which holds the rotating eu presidency , said : " we must intensify bilateral dialogue during president bush 's second term and rediscover our common ground . "</seg>
<seg id=119>ms . waldner , eu external relations commissioner , said she believed europe and the united states have made some progress in " putting the difficult moments of the iraq crisis behind , " but she also acknowledged that now is a " key moment in the eu - us relationship . "</seg>
<seg id=120>bush will fly to brussels on february 22 next year to meet with eu and nato leaders .</seg>
<seg id=121>powell said bush 's visit is meant to mend fissures in the relationship caused by the iraq issue .</seg>
<seg id=122>on his visit to europe , powell stopped in sofia and brussels but made only limited progress toward his goal of improving ties .</seg>
<seg id=123>this was especially the case in brussels , where powell criticized six anti-war nato countries for hurting the alliance 's " credibility and solidarity " by refusing to participate in training exercises in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=124>however , powell still insisted his meetings have demonstrated us commitment to fully rehabilitating diplomatic relations .</seg>
<seg id=125>elected as romanian president , basescu faces challenges in organizing government</seg>
<seg id=126>romania 's opposition candidate basescu today won a closely - fought presidential election , but due to a hung parliament , the center - right mayor of bucharest may face tremendous challenges in organizing a new government .</seg>
<seg id=127>according to the final official results released today by romania 's central election commission , " justice and truth alliance " candidate basescu won 51.23% of the vote , while his opponent , prime minister nastase , won 48.77%.</seg>
<seg id=128>nastase conceded defeat and congratulated basescu .</seg>
<seg id=129>outgoing president iliescu has also congratulated basescu .</seg>
<seg id=130>nastase said his social democratic party will assist basescu in securing romania 's smooth accession to the european union .</seg>
<seg id=131>the social democratic party won parliamentary elections held on the 28th of last month .</seg>
<seg id=132>basescu said at a press conference : " my priority today is to form , as soon as possible , a government capable of continuing negotiations for romania 's entry into the european union . " romania must work hard to meet the requirements for eu accession .</seg>
<seg id=133>he stressed that the romanian people should understand the price to pay for this integration . the entire country should unite to ensure there are no dissenting voices in romania against the integration .</seg>
<seg id=134>romania has completed its eu membership negotiations and is scheduled to join the union in january 2007 .</seg>
<seg id=135>basescu 's agenda also includes combating poverty , tackling corruption , and ensuring judicial independence .</seg>
<seg id=136>oliver stone wants to seek peace with turkey in spite of lingering dispute over old screenplay</seg>
<seg id=137>movie director oliver stone , while promoting his new movie " alexander " in istanbul , tried to take the chance today to make peace with turkey .</seg>
<seg id=138>his screenplay for the classic " midnight express " was criticized for tarnishing the image of turkey .</seg>
<seg id=139>in a special interview here he told afp : " it has never occurred to me that this screenplay would be against turkey . this screenplay is meant to be against injustice everywhere . "</seg>
<seg id=140>turkey has been denouncing stone ever since the premier of this award - winning movie in 1978 .</seg>
<seg id=141>the movie was based on the memoirs of billy hayes .</seg>
<seg id=142>hayes , a young american , got arrested at istanbul airport while trying to smuggle hashish from turkey . after a protracted lawsuit , he was sentenced to 30 years in jail in turkey .</seg>
<seg id=143>turkish critics accused stone of taking liberties with hayes 's original work and rewriting it as a racist screenplay in which every turkish character is , without exception , described as a villain .</seg>
<seg id=144>the movie is also filled with horrific prison scenes of rape and torture .</seg>
<seg id=145>stone admitted : " perhaps some of the zealousness , some of the anger came from being young at that time and trying to make the point too much , too hard . "</seg>
<seg id=146>but he added : " it was true that billy hayes did get screwed in the turkish prison . he was convicted for relatively nothing to 30 years in jail , and he was treated brutally in prison . so this is all based on facts . "</seg>
<seg id=147>stone said : " for a larger picture , turkey is not the only country that runs an imperfect prison system . america has similar problems . "</seg>
<seg id=148>japan 's economy may slow down next year</seg>
<seg id=149>japan 's economy may slow down in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing gap between rich and poor may spoil the harmonious atmosphere the country enjoyed in the first half of this year .</seg>
<seg id=150>after a decade of stagnation , high corporate profits and strong consumer spending have brought confidence back to japan this year , but analysts put their hopes of sustaining economic growth on china despite growing political tensions between japan and china .</seg>
<seg id=151>the evidence is growing that japan 's economy could suffer a brief downturn in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust their inventories to avoid a glut .</seg>
<seg id=152>according to a new statistic methodology recently adopted , japan 's economy actually shrank slightly in the april - june quarter and grew only 0.1% in the july - september quarter , narrowly escaping a technical recession .</seg>
<seg id=153>at present , economists still hold very different opinions on the momentum of economic rebound in japan .</seg>
<seg id=154>bnp paribas researchers estimated that the actual economic growth in japan can reach 2.3% for both the current fiscal year ending in march next year and the following fiscal year .</seg>
<seg id=155>they called 2005 " the year of recovery " on the grounds that the us economy is on a steady recovery track and japan 's consumer spending is making up for slower exports .</seg>
<seg id=156>in another more pessimistic view , ufj institute economists projected only 1.8% growth in this fiscal year and even a much slower growth of 0.6% for the following fiscal year .</seg>
<seg id=157>they cited the " potential risk , " which means corporate profits do not lead to higher personal incomes .</seg>
<seg id=158>french foreign minister : middle east peace process will test ties between france and us</seg>
<seg id=159>after meeting us secretary of state powell today , french foreign minister barnier said the efforts to revive middle east peace talks will " test " their trans - atlantic ties .</seg>
<seg id=160>after the death of the palestinian leader arafat , france called for an immediate international conference to push for the peace process between israel and palestine . however , there has n't been any sign of reaching an agreement after barnier and powell finished their meeting .</seg>
<seg id=161>barnier flew to washington from paris for a lightning round of talks with powell and his internally designated successor , national security adviser rice , before turning around and heading to brussels for an eu summit .</seg>
<seg id=162>both paris and washington agreed to repair bilateral relations strained by the us invasion of iraq last year , but the two countries still remain very much divided on the resolution to the middle east deadlock .</seg>
<seg id=163>after a brief talk with powell at the us state department , barnier said : " we hope to improve future relations between france and the united states , and between europe and america . "</seg>
<seg id=164>he said : " i think the test at the heart of this relationship ... is our ability to launch the peace process between palestine and israel . "</seg>
<seg id=165>earlier this week barnier called for an immediate international conference on the middle east to take advantage of what he termed a " window of opportunity " created after arafat 's death last month .</seg>
<seg id=166>but powell still did not want to make any commitment .</seg>
<seg id=167>he said the two had spoken of british plans to hold a meeting participated by palestinians but did not mention whether a broader international conference would be held .</seg>
<seg id=168>us officials have made it clear that their priority is to promote peace in israel and palestine and to ensure smooth palestinian elections next month .</seg>
<seg id=169>the elections will produce a leader who could rein in islamic militants and revive talks between israel and palestine .</seg>
<seg id=170>foreign minister machimura proposes japan and south korea hold fta negotiations next january</seg>
<seg id=171>japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura proposed today that japan and south korea hold negotiations on a free trade agreement ( fta ) as early as january next year .</seg>
<seg id=172>according to the report by jiji press , during a meeting with ban ki - moon , south korea 's minister of foreign affairs and trade , in ibusuki city of the southern kagoshima county , machimura said the two sides should resume the negotiations as early as possible since both tokyo and seoul authorities hope to sign an fta by the end of 2005 .</seg>
<seg id=173>before machimura 's talks with ban ki - moon , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and south korean president roh moo - hyun held a summit on the 17th . during the talks , roh moo - hyun urged tokyo authorities to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions against north korea .</seg>
<seg id=174>as north korea abducted several japanese nationals during the cold war , prime minister koizumi is under tremendous public pressure to punish north korea .</seg>
<seg id=175>after japanese researchers confirmed last week that the remains provided by pyongyang authorities to prove the death of the two hostages were not the remains of the parties involved , the families of kidnapping victims were outraged .</seg>
<seg id=176>apart from the abduction issue , koizumi and roh moo - hyun agreed that six - party talks aimed at halting north korea 's development of nuclear weapons should resume as early as possible .</seg>
<seg id=177>since north korea 's secret development of nuclear weapons triggered a stand - off in october 2002 , three rounds of six - party talks have taken place but all failed to achieve concrete results .</seg>
<seg id=178>north korea later boycotted a fourth round of six - party talks originally scheduled for september this year .</seg>
<seg id=179>the six parties for the talks are respectively south korea , north korea , the united states , china , japan , and russia .</seg>
<seg id=180>thai premier thaksin still expected to win elections in february next year</seg>
<seg id=181>when thai premier thaksin heads into 2005 , he is confident of winning a second four - year term . however , his reputation has already been tarnished because he has failed to quell a bloody separatist insurgency .</seg>
<seg id=182>as thailand 's national elections have been scheduled for february 6 next year , thaksin and his political opponents are actively preparing for the elections . in the opinion of most analysts , he is expected to win despite this year 's serious southern violence and epidemic of bird flu .</seg>
<seg id=183>this year a total of twelve people in thailand died from bird flu , which swept across much of asia but was particularly devastating in thailand . the thai government frankly admitted it " made a mistake " in its handling of the epidemic .</seg>
<seg id=184>however , this health concern is unlikely to ruin thaksin 's chance of a second term . on the contrary , many people are asking only how extensive his victory will be , and what will his election victory mean to the muslim insurgency in the southern provinces .</seg>
<seg id=185>kraisak , chairman of the parliamentary senate 's committee on foreign affairs , told afp : " the phenomenon here is that no matter how you look at thaksin , he has won broad popular support at this moment . "</seg>
<seg id=186>he said : " but things will start to disintegrate next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and those close to him ) , the social injustices and the violence . "</seg>
<seg id=187>it is exactly because of social injustice and violence , insurgency broke out in the muslim - dominant deep south of thailand , where sporadic separatist incidents have occurred continuously since january .</seg>
<seg id=188>since january this year , islamic radicals have targeted buddhists , government officials and security forces in gun battles and they have also carried out bombings and beheadings . as of now more than 560 people have died , and another 100 are missing .</seg>
<seg id=189>palestinian cabinet secretary claims arafat was poisoned about a year ago</seg>
<seg id=190>abdelrahman , cabinet secretary for late palestinian leader arafat , disclosed that arafat was poisoned a year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his ramallah headquarters .</seg>
<seg id=191>abdelrahman told the al - hayat newspaper : " about a year ago , something strange happened to arafat . it was on september 25 , 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=192>at that time the chairman was shaking hands one by one with some 30 representatives of supporters . shortly afterwards , the chairman started to vomit .</seg>
<seg id=193>since then the chairman 's health started to deteriorate gradually . "</seg>
<seg id=194>arafat died of a mysterious illness in a french hospital on november 11 .</seg>
<seg id=195>some of palestinian top officials thought arafat had been poisoned .</seg>
<seg id=196>however , french doctors said there was no medical basis for such allegations .</seg>
<seg id=197>two weeks before the delegation visit to arafat mentioned by abdelrahman , the israeli cabinet headed by prime minister sharon had just made the decision to depose arafat , only without specifying by what means .</seg>
<seg id=198>this threat from israel prompted a wave of people 's support for arafat , who subsequently received several delegations of supporters .</seg>
<seg id=199>abdelrahman recalled , " arafat shook hands with these people who came to express their support for arafat besieged by israel . "</seg>
<seg id=200>on september 25 last year , arafat received two groups successively . one was a group of cyclists from around the world on a peace mission . the other was a group of political activists .</seg>
<seg id=201>abdelrahman pointed out , " october 12 this year was the last time when arafat got ill . the symptoms were the same , vomiting , lack of appetite and all the similar symptoms of having the flu . "</seg>
<seg id=202>bush admits need to step up training for iraqi troops and vigorously defends rumsfeld</seg>
<seg id=203>us president bush admitted today that iraqi troops are not yet ready to replace us troops and warned that the elections scheduled for january 30 next year would not spell the end of serious violence in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=204>in an - hour - long press conference , bush also expressed his support for defense minister rumsfeld , insisting the pentagon chief was " doing a really fine job . "</seg>
<seg id=205>bush said , despite some sharp disagreements sometimes , he vowed to continue working with russian president putin . he also said that now is the time to make progress toward ending the middle east conflict .</seg>
<seg id=206>he also believed that the best way to deal with surviving " axis of evil " members iran and north korea is to go through multilateral diplomacy .</seg>
<seg id=207>after yesterday 's successive car bombings killed 66 people and injured more than 200 in the two iraqi islamic shiite pilgrimage cities of najaf and karbala , bush admitted frankly that violence was taking its toll on iraqi people but insisted the elections in january must take place as scheduled .</seg>
<seg id=208>bush warned americans that iraq 's elections " are just the beginning of a political process " and cautioned that " i certainly do n't think the process will be trouble - free . "</seg>
<seg id=209>bush also acknowledged that training iraqi security forces had mixed results .</seg>
<seg id=210>he said : " sometimes when fighting intensified , they ( iraqi troops ) would desert the battlefield . "</seg>
<seg id=211>he said this kind of iraqi troops will never be able to protect the national security , which is unacceptable .</seg>
<seg id=212>however , he believed that after a long period of training by us troops , the training of iraqi troops will achieve results .</seg>
<seg id=213>white house : iraqi insurgents ' attempt to sabotage elections is doomed to fail</seg>
<seg id=214>in response to insurgents ' attack on a dining hall in a us military base in the major city of mosul in northern iraq at noon today that killed 22 us and iraqi soldiers and injured more than 60 , the white house spokesman mcclellan said there will be more rampant terrorist activities by iraqi insurgents as iraqi elections approach , but these " enemies of freedom " will be surely wiped out .</seg>
<seg id=215>reports from iraq said that a single massive explosion occurred at noontime in a us military base dining hall when officers and soldiers were eating , resulting in heavy casualties .</seg>
<seg id=216>the iraqi provisional government set january 30 for the first elections since the downfall of the hussein regime .</seg>
<seg id=217>the united states has sent nearly 20,000 additional troops to ensure security in iraq during the elections .</seg>
<seg id=218>the total number of us troops in iraq during the elections will reach 150,000 .</seg>
<seg id=219>mclellan said as the elections approach , hussein loyalists and insurgents will create more terrorist attacks in an attempt to sabotage the interim government . they want to go back to the past but " they will be wiped out , and they are being wiped out . "</seg>
<seg id=220>reacting to a latest poll which shows 56% of americans think the iraq war " is not worth fighting , " 57% disapprove the way president bush is handling the situation in iraq , and 52% think defense minister rumsfeld should step down , mclellan said president bush will not dance attendance on polls .</seg>

<seg id=222>crowds of mourners attend funeral for philippine politician poe</seg>
<seg id=223>a large crowd of filipino movie fans attended today 's funeral for poe , the country 's most famous movie star . the ceremony was conducted under tight security for fear of unrest .</seg>
<seg id=224>poe , 65 , had unsuccessfully run for president .</seg>
<seg id=225>a crowd of mourners escorted the coffin carrying poe 's body as it was pulled through the streets of the capital of manila on a carriage drawn by two white horses .</seg>
<seg id=226>an army of riot police was deployed around malacanang palace to prevent violence from poe supporters .</seg>
<seg id=227>these supporters had accused president arroyo of cheating in the may 10 presidential election .</seg>
<seg id=228>the military also raised its alert level due to intelligence reports about an imminent coup to overthrow arroyo and replace her with rocess , poe 's surviving widow .</seg>
<seg id=229>however , the funeral procession ended peacefully . movie fans shouted out the letters fpj , the initials of poe 's name , and waved his campaign posters .</seg>
<seg id=230>poe died of a stroke on december 14 .</seg>
<seg id=231>as the hearse wound its way toward the cemetery , weeping women and children tossed flowers at the coffin .</seg>
<seg id=232>following justice secretary gonzales 's warning that some people might take advantage of the funeral to make trouble , large freight containers were placed as road blocks around malacanang palace close to the funeral procession route .</seg>
<seg id=233>gonzales said that " reliable intelligence reports " indicated a plot to use the occasion of the funeral procession and interment to incite people against the government .</seg>
<seg id=234>however , lt . col . pascual , a military spokesman , said that the political coup had apparently dissipated after the military deployed troops to guard key areas .</seg>
<seg id=235>arroyo later walked out of malacanang palace to greet the military police who were guarding the area .</seg>

<seg id=237>us deputy secretary of state armitage issued warnings to syria today , saying the development of future relations between damascus and washington depends on whether syria wants to cooperate with the united states on the issues of iraq and lebanon .</seg>
<seg id=238>armitage renewed greater pressures on syria when he was interviewed by reporters from arab countries .</seg>
<seg id=239>the interview was released earlier by the state department .</seg>
<seg id=240>asked whether he expected continued tensions between the united states and syria , armitage replied : " i certainly hope the relations will be improved , but this depends on how ( syrian president ) al - assad and his men behave . "</seg>
<seg id=241>the us state department number two pointed out that damascus should implement the un security council resolution 1559 passed in september this year and end as soon as possible all interferences in its neighboring country lebanon .</seg>
<seg id=242>armitage said syria 's behavior was " not a defiance of the united states but a defiance of the entire international community . "</seg>

<seg id=246>ait and tecro sign lease today for new building site in neihu</seg>
<seg id=247>the american institute in taiwan ( ait ) and the taipei economic and cultural representative office ( tecro ) signed a lease today for a new building site in neihu . douglas paal , director of the ait taipei office , said the new building is now being designed , and that he hopes it will be completed soon so the institute 's work can be done in a safe and modern facility .</seg>
<seg id=248>douglas paal and tecro secretary general john chen signed a 99 - year lease for the new ait office building site at noon in taipei 's chun yue hotel .</seg>

<seg id=250>ait , established under the taiwan relations act to handle unofficial civil exchanges between the united states and taiwan , has offices in taipei and kaohsiung .</seg>
<seg id=251>douglas paal said in his speech that ait has been working with tecro and the taipei city government for over a decade to find a new ait office building site .</seg>
<seg id=252>he said the current office at hsing yi road looks shabby and lacks enough space .</seg>
<seg id=253>for ait , relocating to the new office building will be a challenge , as it will be able to consolidate offices currently scattered throughout taipei to operate in a safe and modern facility .</seg>
<seg id=254>he said the new building is currently being planned and designed in a way that he hopes will add features to taiwan 's architecture and become a point of pride for taipei residents .</seg>
<seg id=255>upon completion of the planning and design , contract bidding will be set for construction , which will begin right after the contractor has made its decision . it is hoped that groundbreaking will take place within the next few years .</seg>
<seg id=256>ait spokeswoman dana shell - smith said the building 's cost , including the site lease and architectural design , is estimated at about us $160 million . its completion in 2008 depends on many factors , though it is hoped to be done as quickly as possible .</seg>

<seg id=263>late palestinian leader arafat was a regular guest at the midnight mass in bethlehem following his return to the palestinian area in 1994 . but since early december 2001 , arafat had been confined to his ramallah headquarters by israeli troops .</seg>
<seg id=264>the latin patriarch sabbah of jerusalem left that city in early afternoon for his traditional trip to bethlehem 's manger square , where thousands of christian pilgrims and muslim spectators had long been congregating .</seg>
<seg id=265>sabbah was scheduled to address thousands of pilgrims at church of the nativity midnight mass .</seg>
<seg id=266>by noon , manger square was packed with a continuous stream of pilgrims toting santa claus balloons entering and leaving the church of the nativity . outside the church , a christmas tree was festooned with various lights and decorations .</seg>
<seg id=267>israeli authorities eased travel restrictions in a special effort to make it convenient for christians from the gaza strip , the west bank , and israel to attend christmas eve mass in bethlehem .</seg>
<seg id=268>putin claims taking over main asset of yukos was for protecting national interest</seg>
<seg id=269>russian president putin said today that russia was protecting its national interest by its acquisition of the main asset of russia 's oil giant yukos , a first move of re-nationalization in the post-soviet era .</seg>
<seg id=270>referring to rosneft 's acquisition of yuganskneftegaz , a yukos subsidiary , putin said at the end - of - year press conference held in the kremlin : " russia is now protecting the national interest by using absolute legal market mechanism .</seg>
<seg id=271>and i consider this perfectly normal . "</seg>
<seg id=272>rosneft today has become the new owner of yuganskneftegaz after acquiring baikalfinansgroup which won yuganskneftegaz earlier at a secretive auction .</seg>
<seg id=273>earlier last midnight rosneft announced unexpectedly that it had acquired 100% of shares of the previously unknown baikalfinansgroup .</seg>
<seg id=274>the acquisition allows kremlin to have a tight control of russia 's critical energy sector .</seg>
<seg id=275>for nearly 18 months in the past , russian authorities had been attacking yukos and its imprisoned billionaire founder khodorkovsky .</seg>
<seg id=276>since rosneft is merging with gazprom , combined with yuganskneftegaz , the consolidated trio will control one fifth of russia 's total oil output and all its natural gas production to become the world 's largest energy group .</seg>
<seg id=277>putin justified the state 's current acquisition by criticizing the under - the - table privatization in the 1990s .</seg>
<seg id=278>the privatization measures at that time caused the crown jewels of the russian economy to fall into the hands of a few slick businessmen such as khodorkovsky .</seg>
<seg id=279>baikalfinansgroup earlier won the controlling rights to yuganskneftegaz by offering us $9.35 billion for the bid .</seg>

<seg id=337>koizumi also said that he will attend the meeting of world leaders to be held on the 6th in the indonesian capital of jakarta to discuss assistance to tsunami - stricken countries .</seg>
<seg id=338>after us president bush was accused of being slow to respond to this human catastrophe , the us government increased its pledge of aid tenfold to us $350 million yesterday .</seg>
<seg id=339>china , which is seen as increasingly challenging japan 's influence in asia , has also promised us $60.5 million in aid , a huge sum for a developing nation .</seg>
<seg id=340>koizumi said : " japan will mobilize fire department helicopters and personnel to make further contribution .</seg>
<seg id=341>japan will also consider providing more assistance , as soon as possible , including mobilizing japan 's self-defense forces aircraft , ships and personnel . "</seg>

<seg id=355>powell predicts shiite victory in iraqi elections</seg>
<seg id=356>us secretary of state powell today predicted a shiite victory in the upcoming iraqi elections , but he also believed there should not be too much concern that the shiite victory may increase iranian influence because there are past disagreements between iraqi and iranian shias .</seg>
<seg id=357>there has been growing evidence that sunni muslims may boycott the elections on january 30 or may be prohibited from participating in the elections by the relevant iraqi authorities due to their spreading of insurgency .</seg>
<seg id=358>powell said on nbc 's meet the press program : " the new government going into power and the transitional national assembly will be majority shiite .</seg>
<seg id=359>the majority of iraqi population is also shiite . "</seg>
<seg id=360>shiite muslims make up more than 60% of iraq 's population , living mostly in southern and central areas .</seg>
<seg id=361>on the other hand , sunnis live in central and western provinces and comprise 20% of the population .</seg>
<seg id=362>former foreign minister pachachi , who now heads the sunni - dominated " iraqi independent democrats party , " called today for postponing the elections , but powell said the iraqi elections will go ahead as scheduled .</seg>
<seg id=363>powell also said he did not think shiites ' control of the future iraqi government could mean iran would manipulate the political situation in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=364>he said : " my feeling now is that even if there might be iranian influence -- iran will , of course , try to influence the political situation in iraq , but there are quite significant differences and past serious disagreements and conflicts between iranian and iraqi shias . "</seg>
<seg id=365>time is running against tsunami victims as international relief aid pours in</seg>
<seg id=366>foreign troops on relief mission are dropping food from helicopters in areas hit by the asian tsunamis and setting up drinking water distribution systems to assist millions of displaced and famished tsunami survivors .</seg>
<seg id=367>according to statistics , the death toll has climbed to nearly 150,000 .</seg>
<seg id=368>relief supplies from governments keep coming in while us president bush put his father , bush senior , and former president clinton in charge of efforts to raise private donations .</seg>
<seg id=369>in the meantime , the delegation led by us secretary of state powell arrived in thailand last night to show us concern and assess the progress of relief efforts before they head off to a crisis summit to be held in the indonesian capital of jakarta on the 6th .</seg>
<seg id=370>powell 's delegation includes president bush 's brother jeb bush , governor of florida , and natsios , administrator of us agency for international development .</seg>
<seg id=371>powell , heading the delegation , will tour thailand , indonesia , and sri lanka to inspect the disaster devastation before attending the summit on the 6th .</seg>
<seg id=372>powell said the mission of his delegation is to assess the disaster situation and " see what else the united states needs to do , " but there will be no immediate promise of additional aid beyond the us $350 million already committed .</seg>
<seg id=373>as days went by after the disaster , there are talks now of giving up the search for thousands of tourists not yet accounted for . many of them were foreign tourists .</seg>
<seg id=374>but thai premier thaksin vowed to continue the search in his country .</seg>
<seg id=375>thaksin told reporters on phuket island : " foreign experts told me they ( the missing ) might have been buried in mud in mangrove forests . we will continue the search by all means and will not stop . "</seg>
<seg id=376>the international relief effort of the largest scale in history is still underway .</seg>
<seg id=377>navy helicopters dispatched from the us aircraft carrier " the lincoln " have been on their mission to drop relief supplies and pick up survivors in the indonesian province of aceh for a second day .</seg>
<seg id=378>rear admiral crowder , commander of the lincoln , said 50,000 pounds of food and water had so far been delivered to affected areas and the operation was " going smoothly . "</seg>
<seg id=379>behind tsunami catastrophe relief efforts lies political jostle</seg>
<seg id=380>as asian tsunami disaster relief supplies continuously poured into affected areas , a less praiseworthy operation is also secretly underway : governments are jostling over who should be giving money , who should be receiving aid and who should be leading this relief operation of the largest scale in modern times .</seg>
<seg id=381>the catastrophe that has killed nearly 150,000 people has rekindled the old fire of war , including the discord among the united states , the united nations and europe , and the struggle for leadership in asia .</seg>
<seg id=382>relief experts , however , are still hoping with caution that the global nature of this tsunami catastrophe that devastated so many countries might lead to another precedent : governments that promised to provide aid will actually honor their words .</seg>
<seg id=383>juma , professor of international development of harvard 's kennedy school of government , said : " promises of aid made by governments have never been carried out 100% and on time . "</seg>
<seg id=384>with pledged donations from governments hitting us $2 billion , major players in the international political arena including un secretary general annan and us secretary of state powell , and leaders from australia , china and japan will hold a crisis summit with strong political overtones in jarkata on the 6th .</seg>
<seg id=385>after accusations of a slow response and top un relief official egeland 's public criticism of rich countries for " being stingy , " us president bush raised us aid nearly tenfold to us $350 million .</seg>
<seg id=386>in asia , the tsunami catastrophe triggered a secretive jostle for regional influence as an increasingly confident china pledged us $60.5 million in aid , an impressive big sum for a developing country .</seg>
<seg id=387>japan , which has cut down foreign aid budget for six straight years , also quickly debunked the notion that its national power is declining by vowing to provide at least us $500 million in aid , a sum putting all other nations to shame .</seg>
<seg id=388>world leaders arriving to tour disaster - hit sri lanka</seg>
<seg id=389>sri lankan officials said world government leaders including un secretary general annan , us secretary of state powell have arrived in succession in sri lanka to inspect firsthand the devastation of the massive tsunami that claimed 30,600 lives in sri lanka at the end of last month .</seg>

<seg id=418>he said : " i brought up the issue of the peace process and the need to intensify peacemaking efforts .</seg>
<seg id=419>i also discussed the issue with president kumaratunga . "</seg>
<seg id=420>annan 's inability to visit rebel - controlled areas triggered great anger among residents of the rebel - controlled northern city of jaffna . hundreds of people staged a protest in front of the un office in jaffna .</seg>
<seg id=421>the sri lankan government , however , resolutely denied media reports , saying the media " had misled " on the issue .</seg>

<seg id=443>us trade deficit in november hit us $60 billion , setting highest record in history</seg>
<seg id=444>us department of commerce announced data today that us exports shrank 2.3% in november last year , driving trade deficit to a new historic high of us $60.3 billion .</seg>
<seg id=445>while us exports plummeted to a new five - month low of only us $95.6 billion , imports grew 1.3% to a new all time high of us $155.8 billion as the bill for us oil imports increased by 1.3%, or more than us $2 billion to us $14.2 billion .</seg>
<seg id=446>trade deficit increased 7.7% from the adjusted us $56 billion in october last year , a dramatic increase of 50.8% from the us $40 billion in november 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=447>according to a survey conducted by cbs marketwatch , wall street economists predicted the trade deficit on goods and services will shrink to about us $53.3 billion .</seg>
<seg id=448>although a weaker dollar makes us products relatively cheaper both at home and abroad , the us trade deficit continues to widen .</seg>
<seg id=449>the report by the department of commerce today will put pressure on the us dollar and renew calls for washington to do something about the us energy independence and the trade imbalance with china .</seg>
<seg id=450>us exports slipped last november due to a decrease of us $1.4 billion in capital goods exports , including a us $325 - million drop in aircraft and aircraft engines exports .</seg>
<seg id=451>exports of industrial materials , mainly energy , fell by us $800 million .</seg>

<seg id=453>japan defense agency chief : will not forget militarist past and will respect the dignity of neighboring countries</seg>
<seg id=454>japan defense agency chief yoshinori ono said today that japan will not forget its militarist past and will carefully keep in mind the " dignity " of neighboring countries as it takes a higher international profile .</seg>
<seg id=455>asked about possible concern over japan 's dispatch of its self-defense forces to areas hit by south asian tsunamis , ono said : " when we get along with southeast asian countries , we should never forget " the past .</seg>
<seg id=456>he told reporters : " we must build a relationship with our friendly neighbors , which allows us to tell them we mean well .</seg>
<seg id=457>looking back on the past , we should fully respect the dignity of other countries . "</seg>
<seg id=458>noting this year marks the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , ono said : " we hope to be reborn and will cooperate for the new era . "</seg>
<seg id=459>ono has just concluded his tour of several countries hit by south asian tsunamis . he said he could feel the " dignity " of an independent country when the indonesian leader told him japan 's self-defense forces should complete their relief mission by the end of march at the latest .</seg>
<seg id=460>the united nations has expressed concern over the deadline the indonesian government imposed on foreign troops .</seg>
<seg id=461>foreign troops were well credited for delivering relief to tsunami survivors in the most remote areas .</seg>
<seg id=462>nearly 1,000 japan 's sdf troops are on their way to the countries hit by the december 26 tsunami , a natural catastrophe that killed more than 163,000 people .</seg>
<seg id=463>this is the largest deployment of japan 's self-defense forces since the end of world war ii .</seg>
<seg id=464>the us - directed japanese postwar constitution stipulates that the self-defense forces cannot use force .</seg>
<seg id=465>controversy broke out in japan 's media over alleged political interference in nhk program</seg>
<seg id=466>the allegation that the public japan broadcasting corp ( nhk ) was pressured by politicians to delete part of a program on japan 's military draft of women as sex slaves during world war ii a few years ago has pitted liberal japanese media against their conservative counterparts .</seg>
<seg id=467>it was alleged that nhk took out most portions of interviews after its discussion with top political leaders . liberal media criticized nhk for what it did since the majority of those interviewed were critics of japan 's wartime conduct and victims of forced sex slavery .</seg>
<seg id=468>however , conservative newspapers defended nhk 's decision to edit the program , believing the company 's senior executives were obligated to ensure the fairness of the program content .</seg>
<seg id=469>the controversy broke out last week over a program aired in 2001 that featured a mock trial on the crime the japanese military committed in drafting women as sex slaves .</seg>
<seg id=470>the trial , held by a women 's rights group in tokyo in december 2000 , found late japanese emperor hirohito guilty because he allowed japanese military to draft women as sex slaves during the japanese occupation of asian countries .</seg>
<seg id=471>historian said at least 200,000 young women were forced to serve as sex slaves in frontline japanese military brothels during the war . they were mostly from south korea but some of them also came from taiwan , china , philippines and indonesia .</seg>
<seg id=472>the program producer satoru nagai held a tearful press conference on the 13th to disclose the fact that right before the program was aired , nhk senior officials had met with the ruling liberal democratic party lawmakers shinzo abe and shoichi nakagawa , who had expressed concern over the program .</seg>
<seg id=473>according to nagai , nhk senior officials later re-edited and shortened the program .</seg>
<seg id=474>he said : " nhk bowed to political pressures . "</seg>
<seg id=475>abe and nakagawa admitted meeting with nhk officials and telling them to be " fair " but strongly denied pressuring the company .</seg>
<seg id=476>eurozone data to show core inflation under control</seg>
<seg id=477>economists said today that eurozone economic data to be released this week will show core inflation is still under control .</seg>
<seg id=478>in the meantime , eurozone industrial production and french consumer spending are both expected to decline .</seg>
<seg id=479>the eurostat is expected to confirm that inflation rate will rise slightly from 2.2% in november to 2.3% in december when it releases inflation data on the 20th of this month .</seg>
<seg id=480>however , the increase is mainly a reflection of tobacco tax increases , and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9%.</seg>
<seg id=481>core inflation figures will be released together with consumer prices figures .</seg>
<seg id=482>economists pointed out that core inflation , which excludes prices of food , energy , tobacco and alcohol , has stayed at the range of 1.6% and 2% for the past two years .</seg>
<seg id=483>european central bank president trichet said on the 13th that short - term price pressures have diminished recently .</seg>
<seg id=484>although inflation will remain above 2% for the coming few months , it may decline by the end of the year .</seg>
<seg id=485>meanwhile , another economist said that given the slowing growth in germany , eurozone industrial output expectations for november to be released on the 18th are also expected to decline .</seg>
<seg id=486>german industrial output declined 1.7% in november , while a survey of economists conducted by afp 's subsidiary afx news shows that eurozone industrial output will fall again by 0.4% in november after a drop of 0.5% in october .</seg>
<seg id=487>schmieding of bank of america said that a rebound in eurozone industrial output expectations is likely in december .</seg>
<seg id=488>tsunami victims hit anew , this time by bureaucracy</seg>
<seg id=489>three weeks after suffering the strongest tsunami attacks in history , survivors are now grappling with the vices of bureaucracy and politicization , while the world 's focus has shifted elsewhere .</seg>
<seg id=490>thousands of decaying bodies continue to be dug out from debris , pushing the death toll of the december 26 tsunami catastrophe to more than 168,000 . in the meantime , the upcoming iraqi presidential elections and bush 's inauguration ceremony have replaced the tsunami disaster as the world media 's top headline news .</seg>
<seg id=491>indonesia has retracted its original demand that foreign troops involved in humanitarian aid missions withdraw within three months .</seg>
<seg id=492>in thailand , leaders from canada , sweden , norway , and finland are discussing reconstruction and efforts to identify dead bodies .</seg>
<seg id=493>however , survivors are facing new difficulties , such as indonesia 's deep - rooted bureaucracy , which has impeded the distribution of relief supplies pouring in from all over the world .</seg>
<seg id=494>in a small village near banda aceh , capital of aceh province on the indonesian island of sumatra , fisherman busriadi said : " it seems like we do not even exist . the tsunami hit us very hard . we have lost everything and we are starving . "</seg>
<seg id=495>he said : " where are the food , clothing , and other relief supplies we saw on tv pouring into aceh ? "</seg>
<seg id=496>like thousands of other disaster victims , busriadi lost his identity card and other official documents due to the tsunami , which turned his efforts to get relief supplies into a nightmare .</seg>
<seg id=497>although he has been begging officials and shuttling daily from one place to another to process paperwork , the result is always the same : no relief aid for him .</seg>
<seg id=498>zeng qinghong said to have visited zhao ziyang before his death</seg>
<seg id=499>the hong kong - based information center for human rights and democracy in china said that before ousted former cpc secretary general zhao ziyang died of illness this morning , china 's vice president zeng qinghong visited him in the hospital .</seg>
<seg id=500>the information center said that according to zhao ziyang 's family , zeng qinghong visited him at 6:00 this morning in a beijing hospital before his death about an hour later . zhao was 85 .</seg>
<seg id=501>formerly cpc secretary general and premier , zhao ziyang was ousted because he opposed the military crackdown on the tiananmen square democratic movement in 1989 . he had been under house arrest since then and had lost favor within the government .</seg>
<seg id=502>the information center said that according to zhao 's family , wen jiabao , incumbent premier who used to work under zhao ziyang , did not come to visit him when he was critically ill .</seg>
<seg id=503>however , before zhao ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th , he was visited by tian jiyun , the retired party central committee member who once worked as his assistant .</seg>
<seg id=504>the information center for human rights and democracy in china has been in regular contact with the zhao family and has released accurate information about zhao ziyang at opportune times for many years .</seg>
<seg id=505>the information center said that some twenty key retired officials from the party , the government , and the military plan to issue a public letter to the cpc calling for a reevaluation of zhao ziyang 's contributions and demanding a public memorial service for him .</seg>
<seg id=506>the center added that zhao ziyang 's family will not receive permission to host or prepare a funeral . the final decision on relevant arrangements will be made by the party .</seg>
<seg id=507>liang boqi , zhao ziyang 's wife , is 86 .</seg>
<seg id=508>the information center said that due to her poor health , she was not informed of her husband 's death until the evening .</seg>
<seg id=509>china widely urged to push for democracy in the wake of zhao ziyang 's death</seg>
<seg id=510>while the world lavished praise on former cpc leader zhao ziyang after his death from illness today , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , the taiwan government , and overseas chinese democracy campaigners all urged beijing to push for democratic reforms envisioned by zhao ziyang .</seg>
<seg id=511>ousted in 1989 for his opposition toward the military crackdown on the tiananmen square democratic movement , zhao ziyang spent the rest of his life under house arrest and passed away in a beijing hospital this morning . he was 85 .</seg>
<seg id=512>according to jiji press , japanese prime minister koizumi said in memory of zhao ziyang : " i hope they ( china ) make efforts toward democratization . "</seg>
<seg id=513>taiwan also urged china to push for democracy and political reforms after the death of zhao ziyang .</seg>
<seg id=514>overseas chinese democracy campaigners praised zhao ziyang as " one of the greatest reformers in china " who sacrificed his political life in opposing the bloody crackdown on the tiananmen square democratic movement .</seg>
<seg id=515>lian shengde , president of the new york - based free china movement and former student movement leader , said : " during the 15 years of his house arrest , he openly advocated the need for political reforms and progress toward rule of law and democracy .</seg>
<seg id=516>zhao ziyang will be fondly remembered by later generations as a true democrat and a man of principle . "</seg>
<seg id=517>some democracy activists are demanding that the chinese government hold a public funeral for zhao ziyang and make a fair evaluation of his contributions .</seg>
<seg id=518>however , they admit the unlikelihood of zhao ziyang receiving such treatment because of chinese government 's fears that a public dissatisfied with the cpc ruling will take advantage of the occasion to create unrest .</seg>
<seg id=519>as it was , the 1989 student movement was triggered by the death of reformist leader hu yaobang .</seg>
<seg id=520>a brief report released by xinhua news agency today that comrade zhao ziyang had died of illness in beijing was the only related official statement .</seg>
<seg id=521>un : rich nations fail to honor pledge to reduce poverty</seg>
<seg id=522>a panel of un - appointed experts said in a new report that the rich nations that promised to deliver financial aid to halve extreme poverty worldwide by 2015 have so far failed to honor their pledge .</seg>
<seg id=523>wealthy nations around the world have promised to participate in " millennium development goals , " an ambitious un program , to improve the lot of the world 's poor and suffering .</seg>
<seg id=524>however , as more than one billion people worldwide are living on less than a dollar a day , and 2.7 billion more are surviving on less than two dollars a day , the un experts said there is n't much time left for rich nations to live up to their promises .</seg>
<seg id=525>director brown of the un development program said : " with the right mobilization of resources and political will , and reforms in developing countries as well as in developed countries , these goals are still achievable . "</seg>
<seg id=526>the un experts said that 22 rich nations worldwide pledged to provide 0.7% of their gross national product in aid to the developing countries , but they have so far only provided 0.25%.</seg>
<seg id=527>un secretary general annan commissioned the development experts led by former harvard economist sachsthe to compile this progress report on meeting the goals , which include wiping out extreme poverty , making primary education universal , cutting child mortality rate , and fighting aids and other deadly diseases .</seg>
<seg id=528>the report said : " the practical solutions exist . the political framework is established . and for the first time , the cost is affordable . all that is needed now is action . "</seg>
<seg id=529>a global disaster warning system to be set up , un announces</seg>
<seg id=530>the united nations announced that a global disaster warning system will be set up to prevent major natural disasters .</seg>
<seg id=531>however , after south asia 's massive tsunami tragedy , there are still differences on which country 's technology is to be used for this disaster warning system .</seg>
<seg id=532>in a joint statement issued after a global conference in kobe , japan , several un agencies said that un experts will establish a global disaster warning system to reduce damages caused by major natural disasters .</seg>
<seg id=533>the severe damages caused by south asia 's massive tsunamis infuriated all the indian ocean nations .</seg>
<seg id=534>director briceno of the international strategy for disaster reduction said : " the new program will bring peace and safety to mankind .</seg>
<seg id=535>an effective early warning system will ensure the lives and safety of millions of people in all parts of the world . "</seg>
<seg id=536>however , this un statement is largely symbolic only .</seg>
<seg id=537>a unesco official said that many more important talks are needed on this disaster warning system .</seg>
<seg id=538>the unesco is spearheading the establishment of a global disaster warning system .</seg>
<seg id=539>bernal , head of unesco 's intergovernmental oceanographic commission , said : " at present , several countries have made different proposals . so we need to make coordination and cooperation efforts . "</seg>
<seg id=540>bernal said the commission will hold two meetings within 60 days , which hopefully can decide on one of the proposals about the tsunami warning system .</seg>
<seg id=541>one of the meetings is to be held in paris , while the location for the other meeting has not yet been decided .</seg>
<seg id=542>bernal hopes that a decision can be reached in july . this global disaster warning system will be completed and put into operation by mid - 2006 , also the target timeline set by the unesco .</seg>

<seg id=563>( hong kong , macao , taiwan ) hong kong observatory provides new services for wmo websites</seg>
<seg id=564>xinhua news agency , hong kong , december 2 beginning on the 2nd of this month , hong kong observatory will provide two new services for the websites of " world weather information service " and " severe weather information center " managed by the world meteorological organization .</seg>
<seg id=565>the observatory spokesperson said the two new services are : adding global official weather observation on cloudiness and rain to the wwis website and adding a recap function to display the tropical cyclone tracks of the past seven days to the swic website .</seg>
<seg id=566>these two services represent hong kong observatory 's provision of yet another new service after it provided the global heavy rain ( including snow ) official observation data to the swic at the beginning of this year .</seg>
<seg id=567>it is learned that the wwis website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatological information for major world cities .</seg>
<seg id=568>the new service provides , for the first time , global official weather observations with a global map of cloudiness and rain as a pilot program .</seg>
<seg id=569>the new web page has a wide and intensive coverage of weather observation data and is updated regularly eight times a day .</seg>
<seg id=570>the new product at the swic website provides a recap function for the tropical cyclone tracks .</seg>
<seg id=571>in the previous design , the original locations and other information of each tropical cyclone were no longer saved on the website once it had dissipated .</seg>
<seg id=572>however , there are people who would like to obtain relevant information about the tropical cyclone several days after it has made landfall .</seg>
<seg id=573>therefore , the new product saves the information on the intensities , locations and tracks of all tropical cyclones that have occurred in the past seven days , allowing the public and the media to retrieve the needed information several days after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated .</seg>
<seg id=574>world 's first quick diagnostic kit for bird flu virus h5n1 developed in shantou</seg>
<seg id=575>xinhua news agency , shantou , december 3 ( zhang siwen and lin junqiang ) reporters learned that the joint influenza research center , partnering the medical schools of shantou university and the university of hong kong , has developed the world 's first quick diagnostic kit for bird flu virus h5n1 , following its nearly six months of work with xiamen university .</seg>
<seg id=576>using this quick testing method to test a suspected case specimen can produce a conclusion about bird flu infection in as fast as one hour .</seg>
<seg id=577>according to an introduction given by professor guan yi , head of the joint influenza research center of the shantou university and the university of hong kong medical schools , the highly pathogenic and deadly bird flu actually has a much higher mortality rate than the sars virus , based on current available data .</seg>
<seg id=578>previously it took at least three to five days , and at times more than one week , to confirm the diagnosis of a " suspected " case of the virus .</seg>
<seg id=579>this successfully developed quick technique for bird flu virus testing uses an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and a gold - based dipstick . specimens able to be tested include excretions , nasal or throat secretions , whole or split virus cultured in a chicken embryo , and serums . a conclusion about bird flu infection can be reached in as fast as one hour , and at most within two hours .</seg>
<seg id=580>the new technique is simple , convenient , and fast . the test can be performed at the site of an outbreak with over 90% accuracy . it can aid the early detection , diagnosis , quarantine , and treatment of the infectious virus , and thereby prevent widespread outbreak and consequent heavy casualties .</seg>
<seg id=581>entrusted by china 's center of disease prevention and control , the joint influenza research center of the shantou university and the university of hong kong medical schools recently held a training workshop on bird flu virus testing and trained staff from centers of disease prevention and control in 20 provinces and cities throughout the country . this latest bird flu quick testing technique was included as part of the program .</seg>
<seg id=582>spokesperson for office of the special commissioner of the ministry of foreign affairs in hong kong expresses great dissatisfaction with speech of hyde , chairman of us house committee on international relations</seg>
<seg id=583>xinhua news agency , hong kong , december 3 a spokesperson for the office of the special commissioner of the ministry of foreign affairs in hong kong spoke on the 3rd to express great dissatisfaction with the recent speech in hong kong by hyde , chairman of the us house committee on international relations .</seg>
<seg id=584>the spokesperson expressed strong dissatisfaction with the speech delivered on the 2nd in hong kong by hyde , chairman of the us house committee on international relations , for his vicious attacks on development and progress in china and his cold war - style defiling of china 's foreign policy .</seg>
<seg id=585>the spokesperson said it is commonly known that china 's development not only serves the basic interests of the 1.3 billion chinese people , but also supports worldwide prosperity and development .</seg>
<seg id=586>on the international stage , china is a responsible nation and has played an active and constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability .</seg>
<seg id=587>on the issue of nuclear nonproliferation , china has always strictly observed relevant international conventions and firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form . china maintains that such issues should be resolved through negotiation , dialogue , and strengthened international monitoring .</seg>
<seg id=588>the spokesperson said that while china - us relations are making healthy and steady progress , it was regretful that mr. hyde ignored objective facts and made these extremely irresponsible remarks . these remarks , totally inconsistent with consensus on the development of bilateral relations reached by chinese and us presidents recently , run counter to the mainstream voice of the us community for strengthened cooperation with china and are undoubtedly harmful to the development of the china - us relationship .</seg>
<seg id=589>china 's largest seawater desalinization project to be built in zhoushan</seg>
<seg id=590>xinhua news agency , hangzhou , december 6 ( pan yifeng and xu qun ) the largest - ever mainland seawater desalinization project , with a daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons , is to be built in putuo district of zhoushan city , zhejiang province .</seg>
<seg id=591>for zhoushan residents , who have long suffered from water shortage , the seawater that has surged around them for thousands of years will soon be turned into fresh , sweet running water flowing into tens of thousands of households .</seg>
<seg id=592>reporters learned from relevant departments that the hangzhou water treatment technology development center under the state oceanic administration and liuheng township government of putuo district , zhoushan city have recently signed a cooperation agreement on a seawater desalinization project with daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons .</seg>
<seg id=593>with daily production of 10,000 tons of fresh water , the 50 - million - yuan seawater desalinization project would have the mainland 's largest treatment capacity so far . the project 's first phase is expected to be completed by next year .</seg>
<seg id=594>zhoushan is one of the cities in china with serious water shortages .</seg>
<seg id=595>there are 1,390 islands of various sizes within the city . fresh water per capita is 601 cubic meters , which is only 25.4% of the average fresh water per capita in zhejiang province . water supply has always been a problem in the life of this island city 's residents .</seg>
<seg id=596>in putuo district 's liuheng township for example , 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be shipped daily from a neighboring town at the cost of more than ten yuan per ton .</seg>
<seg id=597>the reverse osmosis seawater desalinization technology developed by the hangzhou water treatment technology development center under the state oceanic administration is a pressure - driven membrane separation process , currently a hot subject in international seawater desalinization research .</seg>
<seg id=598>the relevant authority at the center said that through technological improvement and by retrofitting domestic - made equipment , both the costs of the reverse osmosis seawater desalinization project and its energy consumption have been reduced .</seg>
<seg id=599>the cost of seawater desalinization treatment has been further reduced from 5 yuan per ton .</seg>

<seg id=640>the three gorges project design calls for the installation of 26 700 - mw water turbine generating units , for a combined capacity of 18,200 - mw , which upon completion will generate 84.7 billion kwh of electricity annually .</seg>
<seg id=641>in order to further tap the power generation potential of the three gorges project , the preliminary design of the project reserved space for expanding the underground power station .</seg>
<seg id=642>according to an executive with china yangtze river three gorges project development corporation , the three gorges underground power station is to be set in the mountain on the right bank of the three gorges dam , with its principal construction including intake tower , diversion tunnel , principal plant building , tailrace system , bus shaft , and 500kv transformer substation .</seg>
<seg id=643>six 700 - mw generating units will be installed in the underground power station .</seg>
<seg id=644>thus , the total number of generating units installed in the three gorges project will be increased from the originally planned 26 to 32 , while installed generation capacity will rise to 22,400 - mw from 18,200 - mw , significantly boosting the three gorges project power generation capacity .</seg>

<seg id=772>reporters learned this information on the 22nd at the china ganzhou tungsten industry development strategy forum currently underway .</seg>
<seg id=773>hard alloy , known as " industrial teeth , " is used to make cutting tools , high pressure tools , and mining and road construction machinery due to its extreme hardness and wear resistance . hard alloy industry development plays an important role in the development of the entire tungsten industry .</seg>
<seg id=774>sources said that china 's hard alloy industry , beginning from scratch in the 1950s , has grown steadily toward its current status through remarkable achievements .</seg>
<seg id=775>in the early 1980s when the annual worldwide hard alloy output was 25,000 tons , china produced about 5,000 tons of hard alloy per year . entering the 21st century , annual global hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons , while china 's hard alloy production has soared to 15,000 tons , exceeding one third of worldwide hard alloy output .</seg>

<seg id=794>xinhua news agency , jerusalem , december 24 james snyder , director of the israel museum , said on the 24th that the museum 's prized possession , the ivory pomegranate , has recently been identified as a forgery .</seg>
<seg id=795>this ivory pomegranate was once considered the only artifact ever discovered of the first temple in solomon 's time .</seg>
<seg id=796>snyder said in a statement that israeli authorities conducted a meticulous examination on the thumb - sized ivory pomegranate .</seg>
<seg id=797>experts found it should be a relic of the bronze period , dating back much earlier than the time of the first jewish temple .</seg>
<seg id=798>a line of hebrew inscription on the pomegranate read : " belonging to the temple of the lord ( yahweh ) , holy to the priests . "</seg>
<seg id=799>however , the inscription was identified as being later added .</seg>
<seg id=800>the israel museum bought the ivory pomegranate from an anonymous collector for us $550,000 in the 1980s .</seg>
<seg id=801>archeologists and artifact experts used to believe it was a treasure embedded by the first temple priest in the top of a scepter and also the only relic left from that period of time .</seg>
<seg id=802>snyder said that prior to the purchase , the ivory pomegranate was authenticated by the israeli archaeologist nahman avigad and other experts .</seg>
<seg id=803>according to the report by israel 's newspaper haaretz , avigad ran a cursory examination of the relic using only a magnifying glass at that time .</seg>
<seg id=804>avigad himself denied this allegation .</seg>
<seg id=805>in recent months , israeli police uncovered three large - scale antiquity frauds in succession and questioned hundreds of people .</seg>
<seg id=806>during the investigations , the police and the antiquities authority discovered by chance that the ivory pomegranate was a forgery .</seg>

<seg id=814>according to an investigation by the shenzhen municipal water administration , more than 70 complexes in shenzhen were equipped with " reclaimed water " recycling systems during the mid - 1990s , but the construction firms had to abandon their use due to the high costs of recycling and utilizing " reclaimed water " associated with the technology , design , and management .</seg>
<seg id=815>to put these pipelines into actual use , it needs only an additional investment of 300,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan to install a " reclaimed water " treatment system .</seg>
<seg id=816>based on daily usage of 500 tons of " reclaimed water " by each residential subdistrict , shenzhen could save 35,000 tons of running water per day using the 70 - plus existing sets of " reclaimed water " pipelines .</seg>
<seg id=817>sources said that shenzhen 's " reclaimed water " recycling project will start with the renovation of the 70 - plus complexes that were originally equipped with " reclaimed water " recycling systems . further promotion will be based on assessment of feedbacks .</seg>

<seg id=868>it is also reported that while talking about the reason why the auctioned yugansk assets will not be incorporated into gazprom 's corporate assets , russia 's industry and energy minister khristenko said on the same day that it was largely because the state is already the major shareholder of gazprom and does not want to add more to its controlling shares .</seg>

<seg id=1>bahraini princess married us soldier , sensational marriage breaks up in five years</seg>
<seg id=2>bahraini princess meriam al - khalifa 's marriage with the humble us marine johnson was once a widely hailed story by us television channels . however , their thorny marriage has now ended in the desert gambling town of las vegas after lasting for just five years .</seg>
<seg id=3>the fairy - tale marriage between meriam , a member of the gulf state of bahrain 's royal family , and us marine johnson , who devoted himself to this banned love affair , risking his military career , became the subject of a television movie .</seg>
<seg id=4>but the las vegas review - journal reported that merely five years had passed before the couple confronted each other in court when meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town where procedures for marriages are quick and for dissolutions are quicker .</seg>
<seg id=5>the two met in 1999 when johnson was a career army man stationed in bahrain .</seg>
<seg id=6>but his life changed dramatically when he met the young teenage princess and the pair fell in love .</seg>
<seg id=7>the young couple 's union was forbidden by the royal family , so johnson disguised meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers , taking her out of her home country to the us .</seg>
<seg id=8>after a bitter immigration lawsuit against us authorities , the couple married at the candlelight wedding chapel on the las vegas strip famed for its magnificence when johnson was 23 and the bride was only 19 .</seg>
<seg id=9>but johnson said the wealth of temptations in the " sin city " of las vegas , ongoing tensions with meriam 's wealthy and powerful family , and rumors of a plot to assassinate him had finally contributed to the breakup of the thorny marriage .</seg>
<seg id=10>johnson said he made a living parking cars for hotel and casino guests , while meriam increasingly indulged in the nightlife of the gambling town , frequenting night clubs late at night and ignoring him as her husband .</seg>
<seg id=11>meriam abandoned her husband a year ago .</seg>
<seg id=12>" she has sunk to the bottom , " johnson said .</seg>
<seg id=13>eurozone indicators this week will suggest weak european economy to continue</seg>
<seg id=14>economists said eurozone economic indicators to be released this week would show further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output , while british data was expected to show increased industrial activity .</seg>
<seg id=15>they said economic output data from the largest eurozone countries would continue to indicate great volatility each month , but the long - term trend of economic output would suggest slowing economic growth .</seg>
<seg id=16>the most crucial figure of the week will be from germany , where the zew institute 's economic expectations indicator , which is closely monitored by the market , is due on the 7th and will provide the first evidence of economic confidence in europe for december .</seg>
<seg id=17>the zew index slumped to 13.9 in november from 31.3 in the previous month .</seg>
<seg id=18>the euro 's significant appreciation would continue to weigh on economic confidence in the recent surveys , so there 's no reason to expect the indicator to rebound , economists said .</seg>
<seg id=19>" considering that the main factors driving down economic confidence , including the euro 's appreciation , uncertainty in the global economy , and a worsening unemployment rate in the german job market have been a drag on future growth expectations during the december survey , a strong rebound in the index is unlikely , " economists at bnp said .</seg>
<seg id=20>according to a survey among economists conducted by afx news , the afp financial news services , the indicator will slip again to 11.0 in december from 13.9 in the previous month .</seg>
<seg id=21>but teather of the ubs investment bank said germany 's zew economic expectations indicator could even drop to zero in december .</seg>
<seg id=22>" future expectations of german economic activity , as reflected in the zew survey among analysts and financial market participants , will continue to fall in our view , " teather said .</seg>
<seg id=23>east - west tension over ukraine crisis to be discussed by the osce</seg>
<seg id=24>repeated accusations by russia of western intervention in eastern european affairs have increasingly been a focus because of the political crisis in ukraine , and the issue is set to dominate the annual ministerial meeting of the organization for security and cooperation opening in europe tomorrow .</seg>
<seg id=25>russia has been unhappy for a long time with the gradual extension of western influence into corners of europe that russia previously considered its backyard , such as the baltic states , georgia , and central asia , and so recent events in ukraine could be an important topic at the two - day osce meeting in the bulgarian capital sofia .</seg>
<seg id=26>the ukrainian supreme court made its dramatic decision , ordering another poll of the second - round runoff for the recent presidential election . even before that , the european union had called on osce member states to get ready for its observers to " act with the greatest speed and efficiency . "</seg>
<seg id=27>a european source said the number of observers sent by the osce could increase from the original 600 to 1000 in ukraine 's new runoff vote , scheduled for december 26 .</seg>
<seg id=28>us secretary of state powell will attend the osce annual meeting , which will be perhaps his last foreign visit before stepping down .</seg>
<seg id=29>the meeting will also be attended by russian foreign minister lavrov , french foreign minister barnier , british foreign minister straw , and their german counterpart fischer .</seg>
<seg id=30>the osce consists of 55 member states from north america , europe , and asia and will mark its 30th anniversary next year .</seg>

<seg id=32>bush 's major test : intelligence reform bill faces congress vote this week</seg>
<seg id=33>the intelligence reform bill that the us congress will try its best to pass this week is an ambitious plan by republican president bush to promote his second term , while his support rate among the republican lawmakers will be his first major test after reelection .</seg>
<seg id=34>in a newspaper interview yesterday , kean , the former republican governor of new jersey responsible for an investigation into the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington in the us , said the problem with the intelligence reform bill was that it had to go through congress , and the process alone bode ill for future bipartisan cooperation and the president 's domestic agenda .</seg>
<seg id=35>" if the president and congress can n't properly solve these big issues , congress will become dysfunctional and we 'll be all in trouble , " kean said .</seg>
<seg id=36>" we 'll then have to wait for a long time before there 's another bill with the support of the republican and democratic leadership in both houses and a support rate of 80 percent in public opinion polls , " he told the new york daily news .</seg>
<seg id=37>a number of lawmakers said yesterday that a failure of the landmark reform bill could delay the overhaul of america 's obsolete spy network operations by months or years , or even end the network altogether .</seg>
<seg id=38>" if the bill fails to pass this week , it 'll be aborted , " harman , top democratic representative in the house intelligence committee , said on cnn yesterday .</seg>
<seg id=39>congress will try again on the 6th and 7th to pass the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 before adjourning till early next year .</seg>
<seg id=40>if it fails , the entire bill will become invalid and will have to wait until 2005 for congress to rewrite it .</seg>
<seg id=41>ukrainian opposition firmly rejects constitutional amendment that significantly weakens presidential powers</seg>
<seg id=42>ukraine 's pro-west opposition today insisted it would not accept the constitutional reform pushed by the outgoing president kuchma ahead of a repeat of the second - round presidential runoff .</seg>
<seg id=43>the constitutional reform would strip a major part of the president 's existing powers .</seg>
<seg id=44>after the supreme court annulled the november 21 election citing widespread malpractices in the second - round vote and the general election commission ordered a repeat of the runoff on december 26 , the opposition leader yushchenko is again locked in a standoff with kuchma .</seg>
<seg id=45>" if the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form , all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament . this would be unacceptable , " said yushchenko 's ally timoshenko .</seg>
<seg id=46>" we want the president to be able to appoint the chief of the intelligence agency and the prosecutor - general so we can fight corruption and eliminate the group that controls ukraine 's political and business circles , " she told reporters .</seg>
<seg id=47>kuchma , who maintains close ties with russia , had pushed for the constitutional amendment before the repeat of the runoff due to his concern that the opposition could win the presidential election .</seg>
<seg id=48>opposition lawmakers yesterday refused to vote on the government - proposed constitutional amendment , which caused the parliament to adjourn for ten days .</seg>
<seg id=49>according to the constitutional amendment , the power to appoint all top posts except for the prime minister , defense minister , and foreign minister will be transferred from the president to parliament , where pro-government forces currently have a near majority .</seg>
<seg id=50>based on what the amendment says , the president 's nominees for the prime minister , defense minister and foreign minister need to be approved by the parliament , which may also name its own candidates .</seg>
<seg id=51>ukraine 's political crisis enters third week , opposition calls for continued struggle</seg>
<seg id=52>ukraine heads into a third week of turmoil caused by the presidential election , amid which opposition leader yushchenko today called on supporters to keep up the street struggle by besieging the presidential palace and government buildings until outgoing president kuchma sacks prime minister yanukovich and his cabinet members and takes steps to ensure the new upcoming presidential run - off is fair .</seg>
<seg id=53>thousands of yushchenko 's supporters have massed in the capital kiev for two weeks , besieging government buildings and camping in the main avenue specially designed by soviet experts for viewing military parades . the power of people yushchenko 's supporters demonstrated forced the supreme court to annul the november 21 second - round presidential election and the general election commission to order a repeat of the runoff on december 26 . while parliament has already voted to sack yanukovich , kuchma has not signed a decree to replace the successor whom he 's been grooming .</seg>
<seg id=54>yushchenko tonight told supporters who gathered at independence square in the capital city that kuchma should replace his administration and reshuffle the general election commission , and that both parliament and kuchma should agree to revise the election law to prevent vote rigging .</seg>
<seg id=55>he said in a speech serving as the prelude to the december 26 runoff that " until these decisions are made , there can be no talk of lifting the blockade of the government buildings or the presidential palace .</seg>
<seg id=56>for 14 days this square has demonstrated a love of ukraine and the civic awareness of millions of ukrainians who are capable of defending their choice . "</seg>
<seg id=57>" we are experiencing a struggle between good and evil forces . the entire world is applauding our victory and the entire world is proud of ukraine , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=58>as the opposition steps up pressure on the moscow - backed ruling authority and yushchenko is again locked in a standoff with kuchma over the constitutional reforms , polish president kwasniewski , lithuanian president adamkus , and russian envoy gryzlov are expected to arrive in kiev on the 6th for a fresh round of mediation .</seg>
<seg id=59>egypt announces breakthrough in middle east peace difficulties</seg>
<seg id=60>egypt said a new framework was expected for the middle east peace deal .</seg>
<seg id=61>it also said it could soon return an ambassador to israel to restore full diplomatic ties after a four - year break .</seg>
<seg id=62>quoting " high - level " egyptian sources , egypt 's state - owned news agency mena said parties seeking a peace plan have gradually reached common understanding on the comprehensive reconciliation .</seg>
<seg id=63>" an important understanding has been reached among egypt , israel , palestine and significant international groups , such as the united states and the european union , agreeing in principle to resolve the israeli - palestinian conflict in a comprehensive way , " mena said .</seg>
<seg id=64>following the death last month of palestinian strong man arafat , the international community has resumed advancement of middle east peace policies aiming to end years of bloody conflicts between israel and palestine as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=65>mena said officials expected that " preparations would last until july , after which political action will begin . "</seg>
<seg id=66>then a conference would be held in washington by parties concerned with the middle east peace process , namely israel and palestine , as well as egypt , the united states , russia , and several european countries , mena said .</seg>
<seg id=67>expected topics include " bilateral ceasefire ; " the palestinian authority would " put a stop to anti-israeli attacks and strengthen its control in the gaza strip and the west bank . "</seg>
<seg id=68>in this regard , mena said , israeli prime minister sharon promised " to halt israeli military operations against the palestinians as long as the palestinian authority respects the ceasefire accord and keeps its land under control . "</seg>
<seg id=69>over one billion children around the world tortured by war , poverty , and aids</seg>
<seg id=70>more than one billion children , half of the world 's population of children , suffer from the scourge of poverty , war and rampant aids , said an annual report released today by the united nations children 's fund ( unicef ) .</seg>
<seg id=71>the rights of children to a healthy and secure growing environment , as laid out in the 1989 convention on the rights of the child , are often jeopardized , due in part to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms , unicef said .</seg>
<seg id=72>" when half of the world 's children are growing up in a hungry and unhealthy environment , when schools become targets of attacks and whole villages are destroyed by aids , we can no longer deliver on our promise to children , " unicef executive director ms . bellamy said while releasing the annual report in london .</seg>
<seg id=73>" too many governments are making deliberate decisions that actually hurt children , " bellamy said .</seg>
<seg id=74>statistics compiled through the joint efforts of researchers from unicef , britain 's london school of economics and bristol university have revealed a terrible scenario of children at risk in much of the world .</seg>
<seg id=75>researchers found that some 640 million children around the world lack adequate shelter , 400 million children have no access to safe drinking water , 270 million children have no access to health care services , and 140 million children ( mostly girls ) have never been to school .</seg>
<seg id=76>more seriously , at last 700 million children suffer from various forms of " severe deprivation , " which includes lacking access to information and not being able to use public sanitary facilities , researchers said .</seg>
<seg id=77>the 10th annual report released by unicef today said war and aids had destroyed networks that normally protected children , and children had at times become direct victims of war and aids .</seg>
<seg id=78>china pushes for lifting arms ban , but eu resists</seg>
<seg id=79>the european union today rebuffed pressure from china 's premier wen jiabao for a quick end to the arms embargo on china , but said it would work towards lifting the 15 - year - old embargo .</seg>
<seg id=80>the eu 's rotating president , the netherlands , made the above comments after a china - eu summit .</seg>
<seg id=81>the netherlands said there was no need to speculate on how the eu would end the embargo .</seg>
<seg id=82>the eu imposed the arms embargo on beijing after the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .</seg>
<seg id=83>though the issue of the arms embargo has shadowed the china - eu summit , the two parties signed several trade and other agreements during the meeting .</seg>
<seg id=84>both china and the eu hailed the agreements as having strengthened the " strategic partnership " between them .</seg>
<seg id=85>" the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " said the eu , in a joint statement released after the summit with chinese premier wen jiabao .</seg>
<seg id=86>the statement said that the chinese delegation " welcomed the positive message and considered it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between china and the eu " .</seg>
<seg id=87>wen jiabao did not hide his displeasure at a press conference after the summit , saying the embargo " fails to reflect the partnership between china and the eu " .</seg>
<seg id=88>" the embargo is a result of the cold war and does not reflect the present situation or the partnership between china and the eu , " wen jiabao said .</seg>
<seg id=89>some eu countries led by france are pushing for a lifting of the embargo , saying the ban is outdated .</seg>
<seg id=90>without amending or strengthening related eu laws , some farsighted people in the eu worry that lifting the embargo could open the floodgates to arms sales , which could boost china 's military forces .</seg>
<seg id=91>" i explained that the eu is willing to lift the embargo but i also noted that lifting the ban is interrelated with adjustments of the code of conduct on arms exports , " said dutch prime minister balkenende .</seg>
<seg id=92>preliminary study finding : folic acid may lead to breast cancer , but no conclusion made</seg>
<seg id=93>a latest heath study reported that " folic acid , " a vitamin b widely taken by pregnant women to prevent fetal malformation , may increase the risk of breast cancer .</seg>
<seg id=94>but the researchers said their results could merely be the result of chance , as other studies have suggested that folic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer , so they urged pregnant women to continue taking the supplement .</seg>
<seg id=95>folic acid is found naturally in dark , leafy vegetables and is known to the medical community as a crucial aid in the growth of the fetus .</seg>
<seg id=96>researchers from the universities of bristol and aberdeen in britain followed 3,000 women who took either five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folic acid or a placebo in the 1960s when they were pregnant , mostly during the second and third phases of their pregnancy .</seg>
<seg id=97>by september 2002 , breast cancer rates among those women who took the five - milligram folic acid were twice as high as those who took the placebo alone , said the report published in a british medical magazine .</seg>
<seg id=98>ness , one of the researchers , stressed the results were merely " preliminary ... aimed at pointing out the way for further research . "</seg>
<seg id=99>" it is entirely possible that this is a result of chance , so further scientific studies are required to examine the association , if there is any , before we reach any conclusions , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=100>ness said women planning to become pregnant should still take folic acid supplements .</seg>
<seg id=101>he said the current dosage recommendation " is far from the experimental dosage . "</seg>
<seg id=102>according to british health guidelines , women hoping to become pregnant or in the first phase of their pregnancy should take 0.4 microgram folic acid daily , which is more than 10 times smaller than the doses taken by those women in the study described above .</seg>
<seg id=103>ukraine 's presidential vote rerun with two candidates in totally different moods</seg>
<seg id=104>the two rivals , who will face off in ukraine 's presidential rematch vote on the 26th of this month , are now prepared for a final duel .</seg>
<seg id=105>yushchenko , the pro-west opposition leader is confident of winning the election , while yanukovich , the pro-moscow sitting prime minister said he was no longer in the election representing the " shameful " ruling party .</seg>
<seg id=106>meanwhile russian president putin made an about turn on ukraine 's bid to join the european union , saying he would be pleased to see ukraine 's entry into the eu .</seg>
<seg id=107>when asked about the percentage of vote he expected to get in the rematch , yushchenko told a press conference packed with reporters : " modestly speaking , i should be able to get some 60 percent . "</seg>
<seg id=108>on the other hand , a visibly fidgety yanukovich evaded answering reporters ' questions several times and finally uttered only one sentence : " by god 's wish we will win . "</seg>
<seg id=109>yanukovich , whom the incumbent president kuchma had originally groomed as his successor , now changed tack and positioned himself as a candidate fighting both the opposition and the ruling party .</seg>
<seg id=110>" i used to trust those cowards and traitors who worked under the government , and now i feel disappointed ... the government is really shameful , " he said , nearly mentioning particular names .</seg>
<seg id=111>as a quid pro quo between kuchma and the opposition party , some of the presidential powers will be transferred to parliament by amending laws , in order to end two weeks of mass opposition resistance and political turmoil following the november 21 presidential runoff .</seg>
<seg id=112>the victory of the original winner yanukovich was annulled by the supreme court , which ruled that the poll was beset by negligence and must be rerun .</seg>
<seg id=113>powell visits hague , making final effort for european - us harmony during his tenure</seg>
<seg id=114>us secretary of state powell held talks with top eu officials today , making a final push in his tenure for unity between the united states and europe .</seg>
<seg id=115>powell 's european tour is aimed at mending the diplomatic damage between the two parties caused by the war in iraq , and the hague is the last leg .</seg>
<seg id=116>powell , on perhaps the last official overseas visit in his tenure , won an eu commitment that the eu would step toward easing the tension before a february visit to europe by us president bush .</seg>
<seg id=117>however , the differences between the two sides still persist .</seg>
<seg id=118>" we have to intensify bilateral dialogue and rediscover common ground in the second term of president bush , " said dutch foreign minister bot , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .</seg>
<seg id=119>eu external relations commissioner ms . waldner said she believed europe and the us had already made progress on " putting the difficult moments of the iraq crisis behind them , " but she also acknowledged that now was a " key moment in the european - us relationship . "</seg>
<seg id=120>bush will fly to brussels on february 22 to meet with eu and nato leaders .</seg>
<seg id=121>powell said the purpose of bush 's visit would be mending the split caused by iraq .</seg>
<seg id=122>powell visited sofia and brussels earlier in his european tour , but achieved only limited progress in the attempt to improve relations .</seg>
<seg id=123>especially in brussels , powell criticized six anti-war nato countries , saying their refusal to participate in the iraqi training missions had harmed the " credibility and cohesion " of the alliance .</seg>
<seg id=124>but powell maintained that his meetings had demonstrated the us commitment to restoring full diplomatic ties .</seg>
<seg id=125>basescu elected as romanian president , faces the challenge of forming government</seg>
<seg id=126>romanian opposition candidate basescu today won the heated presidential campaign , but the center - right bucharest mayor may face tremendous challenges in forming the new government due to a fragmented multipartisan parliament .</seg>
<seg id=127>according to the final official results released today by the central electoral committee , the justice and truth alliance candidate basescu garnered 51.23 percent of the vote , while his rival , prime minister nastase , got 48.77 percent .</seg>

<seg id=129>outgoing president iliescu also congratulated basescu .</seg>
<seg id=130>nastase said his social democratic party would assist basescu with romania 's smooth entry into the european union .</seg>
<seg id=131>the social democratic party won the parliamentary elections held on the 28th last month .</seg>
<seg id=132>basescu told a press conference , " today my top priority is to form , as soon as possible , a government capable of continuing negotiations for romania to join the eu , " and romania must try to meet the requirements for joining the eu .</seg>
<seg id=133>he stressed that the romanian people should know the costs of this integration , and that the whole nation should unite to ensure there were no voices questioning the integration of romania .</seg>
<seg id=134>romania has completed its eu membership talks and is expected to join the eu in january 2007 .</seg>

<seg id=143>critics in turkey have accused stone of turning hayes 's original work into a racist screenplay , in which every turkish character is depicted as a rascal without exception .</seg>
<seg id=144>the film is also full of scary prison scenes of rape and torture .</seg>
<seg id=145>" maybe it was because i was young at that time and wanted to make the point too eagerly and too strongly , which resulted in some zealousness and some anger , " stone acknowledged .</seg>
<seg id=146>but he added : " hayes did get sodomized in the turkish jail . he was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for a relatively negligible offense and was treated brutally in prison . so everything was based on the facts .</seg>
<seg id=147>" seen from a larger perspective , turkey is not the only country where the prison system does n't work well . the united states has similar problems , " stone said .</seg>
<seg id=148>japan 's economic growth may slow down next year</seg>
<seg id=149>japan 's economy may slow down towards 2005 as yen appreciation and a widening gap between the rich and poor could break the harmonious atmosphere it enjoyed in the first half of this year .</seg>
<seg id=150>though high corporate profits and strong consumer spending have restored japan 's confidence this year after a decade of stagnation , analysts count on china to bolster economic growth despite growing political tensions between japan and china .</seg>
<seg id=151>the evidence is emerging that japan 's economy could decline briefly in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to decrease and manufacturers adjust inventories to avoid a glut .</seg>
<seg id=152>based on the new statistical method recently adopted , japan 's economy actually contracted slightly in the april - june quarter and grew only 0.1 percent in the july - september quarter , narrowly evading a technical recession .</seg>
<seg id=153>currently , economists remain widely separated on the strength of japan 's economic rebound .</seg>
<seg id=154>researchers from france - based bnp paribas bank estimate japan 's economic growth may hit 2.3 percent in real terms for both the current fiscal year to next march and the next fiscal year .</seg>
<seg id=155>they call 2005 " the year of recovery " on the grounds that the us economy is strongly back on the track of recovery and japanese consumer spending is making up for the slowdown in exports .</seg>
<seg id=156>a more pessimistic view is from ufj institute economists , who estimate only 1.8 percent growth for the current fiscal year and a growth rate as low as 0.6 percent for the next fiscal year .</seg>
<seg id=157>they cite " potential risks , " meaning that corporate profits do not lead to an increase in personal incomes .</seg>
<seg id=158>french foreign minister : middle east peace process tests french - us relations</seg>
<seg id=159>following his meeting with us secretary of state powell today , french foreign minister barnier said restoration of the middle east peace talks would " test " their trans - atlantic relations .</seg>
<seg id=160>france called for a quick international seminar to push ahead the israeli - palestinian peace process after the death of palestinian leader arafat . but there were no sign of an agreement at the end of the meeting between barnier and powell .</seg>
<seg id=161>barnier flew to washington from paris for a lightning round of talks with powell and his designated successor , national security adviser rice , before heading to brussels for a european union summit .</seg>
<seg id=162>while both paris and washington agreed to mend their strained ties after the us invasion of iraq last year , there were still obvious differences on resolving the middle east impasse .</seg>
<seg id=163>" we hope to improve the future ties between france and the us and between europe and america , " barnier said after a brief discussion with powell at the us state department .</seg>
<seg id=164>" i think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to push ahead the peace process between palestine and israel , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=165>barnier called earlier this week for an early international seminar on the middle east to take advantage of what he called a " window of opportunity " that emerged after arafat 's death last month .</seg>
<seg id=166>but powell remained unwilling to make a promise .</seg>
<seg id=167>he said the two spoke of a british plan to hold a meeting which palestinians will be attending , but they did not mention whether a broader international conference would be held .</seg>
<seg id=168>us officials have said their priority was to promote local peace in israel and palestine and ensure smooth palestinian election next month .</seg>
<seg id=169>the election will produce a leader who can control islamic militants and revive talks between the israelis and the palestinians .</seg>
<seg id=170>japanese foreign minister machimura proposes fta talks between japan and south korea next january</seg>
<seg id=171>japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura proposed today that japan and south korea hold talks on signing a free trade agreement ( fta ) at an early date in january next year .</seg>
<seg id=172>jiji press reported that in a meeting with south korean foreign affairs and trade minister ban ki - moon in ibusuki city , southern japan 's kagoshima prefecture , machimura said the two sides should resume talks at an early date as authorities in tokyo and seoul both expected to sign an fta by the end of 2005 .</seg>
<seg id=173>the talks between machimura and ban ki - moon followed a summit on the 17th between japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and south korean president roh moo - hyun , in which roh moo - hyun urged tokyo to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions on north korea .</seg>
<seg id=174>as north korea abducted more than one japanese national during the cold war , prime minister koizumi is under huge pressure from the public to punish north korea .</seg>
<seg id=175>the families of abduction victims were outraged after japanese researchers concluded last week that the remains presented by pyongyang in a bid to prove the deaths of the hostages were not the remains of those kidnapped .</seg>
<seg id=176>apart from the kidnapping issue , koizumi and roh moo - hyun both agreed that the six - party talks aimed at preventing north korea from developing nuclear weapons should resume as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=177>since the stand - off was provoked in october 2002 by north korea 's secret nuclear weapons program , three rounds of six - party talks have been held but have achieved no concrete results .</seg>
<seg id=178>north korea later boycotted the fourth round of six - party talks originally scheduled for september this year .</seg>
<seg id=179>the six nations in the six - party talks are south korea , north korea , the united states , china , japan and russia .</seg>
<seg id=180>thai prime minister thaksin still widely expected to win general election next february</seg>
<seg id=181>on the eve of 2005 , thai prime minister thaksin is confident of winning a second four - year term , but his reputation is tarnished for his failure to quell a bloody separatist insurgency .</seg>
<seg id=182>with thai national elections scheduled for february 6 next year , thaksin and his political rivals are gearing up for the election campaign . most analysts believe that despite the fierce violent conflicts in the south and the bird flu , he is still expected to win .</seg>
<seg id=183>a total of 12 people died in thailand this year from bird flu , which swept across much of asia but was particularly severe in thailand , where the thai government acknowledged it " made mistakes " in coping with the epidemic .</seg>
<seg id=184>however , this health issue is unlikely to derail thaksin 's reelection . instead , many ask only how clear his sweeping victory will be , and what his victory will mean for the muslim insurgency in the southern provinces .</seg>
<seg id=185>" the phenomenon here is that no matter how you look at thaksin , he now enjoys popular support , " choonhavan , chairman of the senate 's foreign affairs committee , told afp .</seg>
<seg id=186>" but things will begin to fall apart next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and people close to him ) , the social injustices and violence , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=187>it was the issues of social injustices and violence that led to the insurgency in the muslim - majority region in thailand 's southern end , where sporadic separatist rebellions have persisted since january .</seg>
<seg id=188>since january this year islamic radicals have made buddhists , government officials and security forces targets in gunfights , as well as bombings and beheadings . so far more than 560 people have been killed , and another 100 are missing .</seg>
<seg id=189>palestinian cabinet secretary says arafat poisoned about a year ago</seg>
<seg id=190>arafat was poisoned a year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in the ramallah headquarters , the late palestinian leader arafat 's cabinet secretary abdelrahman disclosed .</seg>
<seg id=191>" something strange happened to arafat around a year ago , on september 25 , 2003 , " abdelrahman told the al - hayat newspaper .</seg>
<seg id=192>" at that time , the president vomited after shaking hands one by one with some 30 supporter representatives .</seg>
<seg id=193>the president 's health started deteriorating from then on . "</seg>
<seg id=194>arafat died in a french hospital of an unknown illness on november 11 .</seg>
<seg id=195>several top palestinian officials believed arafat had been poisoned .</seg>
<seg id=196>but french doctors said there was no medical basis for such allegations .</seg>
<seg id=197>two weeks before the visit of the delegation mentioned by abdelrahman , the israeli prime minister sharon 's cabinet had just made a decision to " remove " arafat from his post , although without specifying by what means .</seg>
<seg id=198>israel 's threat triggered waves of public support for arafat , who therefore received several supporter delegations .</seg>
<seg id=199>" arafat shook hands with those people who came to express their support for arafat in israel 's confinement , " abdelrahman recalled .</seg>
<seg id=200>arafat received two groups on september 25 last year : one was a group of cyclists from around the world advocating peace , and the other was a group of political activists .</seg>
<seg id=201>" the last time arafat became ill was on october 12 this year , when he had the same symptoms such as vomiting , poor appetite and all the symptoms similar to a flu , " abdelrahman said .</seg>
<seg id=202>bush admits iraqi forces need to intensify training , offering support to rumsfeld</seg>
<seg id=203>us president bush admitted today that iraqi forces were not yet ready to replace the us troops and warned that the general election slated for january 30 next year would not mark an end to the violent insurgencies in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=204>bush , in a one - hour press conference , also expressed support for defense secretary rumsfeld , believing the pentagon chief was " doing a fine job . "</seg>
<seg id=205>bush said that despite occasional sharp discord , he vowed to keep working with russian president putin , saying now it 's time to progress towards ending the middle east conflict .</seg>
<seg id=206>he also believed that multinational diplomacy was the best way to address the problems of surviving " axis of evil " members iran and north korea .</seg>
<seg id=207>after yesterday 's two successive car bombings in iraq 's holy shiite muslim cities of najaf and karbala that killed 66 people and wounded more than 200 , bush admitted the insurgencies have cost the iraqi people a price but insisted on holding the general election in january as scheduled .</seg>
<seg id=208>bush issued a warning to americans that iraq 's elections " are just the beginning of a political process " and warned that " i certainly do n't expect the process to be smooth sailing . "</seg>
<seg id=209>bush admitted the training of iraqi security forces produced mixed results .</seg>
<seg id=210>" when there are heated clashes sometimes , they ( the iraqi forces ) flee the battlefield , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=211>he said such iraqi forces would never be able to safeguard national security and that was unacceptable .</seg>
<seg id=212>but he believed the training would be fruitful after the iraqi forces finish a long period of training by the us military .</seg>
<seg id=213>white house : iraqi insurgents ' attempt to disrupt elections doomed to fail</seg>
<seg id=214>talking about the attacks by insurgents at noon today on a us military base dining hall in northern iraq 's big city mosul , which killed 22 people and left more than 60 wounded , white house spokesman mcclellan said terrorist activities by iraqi insurgents would be increasingly rampant as iraq 's elections were drawing near , but that these " enemies of freedom " would definitely be eliminated .</seg>
<seg id=215>reports from iraq said officers and soldiers were having lunch when a single huge blast hit the dining hall at a us military base , causing severe casualties .</seg>
<seg id=216>the interim iraqi government is scheduled to hold its first election on january 30 after the downfall of the hussein regime .</seg>
<seg id=217>the united states has sent nearly 20,000 new troops to keep iraq safe during the elections .</seg>
<seg id=218>there will be a total of 150,000 american troops in iraq during the elections .</seg>
<seg id=219>mcclellan said that as the elections drew closer , hardcore insurgents loyal to hussein would generate more attacks in the attempt to derail the transitional government and return to the past , but that " they 'll be eliminated and they are being eliminated . "</seg>
<seg id=220>as for the results of a new poll , which showed that 56 percent of americans considered the war in iraq " not a worthwhile battle , " 57 percent disapproved of president bush 's way of handling situations in iraq , and 52 percent believed defense secretary rumsfeld should step down , mcclellan said president bush would not dance to the tune of the polls .</seg>
<seg id=221>" polls are only figures at one time , and we are continuing our job based on the progress being made in iraq . "</seg>
<seg id=222>sad crowd attends funeral procession of philippine political figure poe</seg>
<seg id=223>a throng of movie fans today attended the funeral of poe , the philippines ' most famous movie star , held under tight security amid fears of an insurgency .</seg>
<seg id=224>poe , who died at 65 , was defeated in the presidential election .</seg>
<seg id=225>the coffin carrying the deceased poe was escorted by a crowd of mourners , as it was pulled through the streets of the capital manila on a carriage drawn by two white horses .</seg>
<seg id=226>hundreds of riot police were deployed around the malacanang palace to prevent poe 's supporters from launching unrest .</seg>
<seg id=227>these people accused president arroyo of rigging the may 10 presidential election .</seg>
<seg id=228>the military also was on heightened alert as intelligence suggested a possible coup to overthrow arroyo and replace her with poe 's widow rocess .</seg>
<seg id=229>however , the funeral ended peacefully , with fans shouting poe 's initials fpj and waving the presidential campaign posters he had used .</seg>
<seg id=230>poe died of a stroke on december 14 .</seg>
<seg id=231>crying women and children shed flowers on the coffin as the hearse wound its way towards the cemetery .</seg>
<seg id=232>the malacanang palace , close to the route of the funeral procession , used huge shipping containers as make - shift barriers amid justice secretary gonzales 's warning that some could use the funeral to stir up trouble .</seg>
<seg id=233>gonzales said there was a " credible intelligence report " of a plot to use the funeral procession and burial to provoke the masses to turn against the government .</seg>
<seg id=234>but armed forces spokesman lieutenant colonel pascual said the coup plot apparently ended in smoke after the military deployed troops to guard key areas .</seg>
<seg id=235>president arroyo later went outside the malacanang palace to greet the troops and police on guard there .</seg>
<seg id=236>armitage warns syria about the need to cooperate with the us on iraq and lebanon</seg>
<seg id=237>us deputy secretary of state armitage warned syria today , saying that the development of future relations between damascus and washington hinged on syria 's willingness to cooperate with the us on iraq and lebanon .</seg>
<seg id=238>armitage kept up the pressure on syria in an interview with arab reporters .</seg>
<seg id=239>the contents of the interview were released earlier by the state department .</seg>
<seg id=240>asked whether he expected relations would remain strained between the us and syria , armitage said : " i certainly hope the ties will improve , but it 's up to how ( syrian president ) assad and his group behave . "</seg>
<seg id=241>the second highest ranked figure of the us state department said damascus should implement un security council resolution 1559 passed in september this year for an early stop to all its interventions in neighboring lebanon .</seg>
<seg id=242>armitage said syria 's behavior " is not against the united states , but is in discordance with the entire international community . "</seg>
<seg id=243>reporters probed whether the us would raise the issue of syrian non-compliance when the un security council discusses the continued presence of the un peacekeeping forces in lebanon in january next year . armitage 's reply was : " we may very well do that . "</seg>
<seg id=244>on the issue of iraq , armitage admitted that damascus had indeed taken some actions in line with us expectations , such as stepping up border patrols jointly with iraq and blocking insurgent funding sources .</seg>
<seg id=245>but he also said syria " needs to make more efforts . "</seg>
<seg id=246>ait and ccnaa today sign lease on neihu site for new building</seg>
<seg id=247>the american institute in taiwan ( ait ) signed a lease with the coordination council for north american affairs today on a site for a new building in neihu . director of the ait 's taipei office douglas paal said a new building is being designed and he hopes for its early completion so as to conduct business in a safe and modern environment .</seg>
<seg id=248>douglas paal and chen chung , secretary - general of the coordination council for north american affairs , signed the 99 - year lease on a site for the ait 's new office building at noon at the grand hyatt hotel taipei .</seg>
<seg id=249>the witnesses were david keegan , deputy director of the ait taipei office , and jacqueline liu , deputy secretary - general of the coordination council for north american affairs ; minister of foreign affairs tan sun chen was also present at the ceremony .</seg>
<seg id=250>ait , with offices in taipei and kaohsiung , was created under the taiwan relations act to handle non-official ties between the american and taiwanese peoples .</seg>
<seg id=251>it was at least over ten years ago when ait began working with the coordination council for north american affairs and the taipei city government to locate a plot of land for the construction of a new ait office building , said douglas paal in his remarks .</seg>
<seg id=252>he said the current offices on hsin yi road looks quite old and are indeed short of space .</seg>
<seg id=253>for ait , relocation to a new office building will be a challenge . ait can consolidate all of its offices currently scattered throughout taipei and do business in a safe and modern environment .</seg>
<seg id=254>he said he hopes the new building , which is under planning and designing , will not only help enhance the beauty of taipei but also become the pride of taipei citizens .</seg>
<seg id=255>upon completion of the planning and designing , tenders will be invited for the construction contract and construction can begin after the builder is selected . hopefully construction can start in a few years .</seg>
<seg id=256>ait spokeswoman dana smith said the whole building is expected to cost about 160 million us dollars , including everything from land rent to design and construction costs ; whether it can be completed by 2008 is up to many factors , but it is hoped work will start as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=257>several thousand followers throng in bethlehem for christmas eve mass</seg>
<seg id=258>several thousand followers were gathering in bethlehem , the west bank , for christmas eve mass .</seg>
<seg id=259>meanwhile fatah , the mainstream faction of the palestine liberation organization , looked likely to beat hamas in yesterday 's palestinian local elections .</seg>
<seg id=260>regarding violence and conflicts , three young palestinians were killed in gunfights between israeli troops and palestinian gunmen in gaza .</seg>
<seg id=261>israeli settlers blocked a main road , protesting mortar attacks on the settlements .</seg>
<seg id=262>the palestine liberation organization leader abbas was also permitted on a trip to the west bank town of bethlehem , which was the first time in the past four years that israel had allowed the top palestinian leader to attend christmas celebrations .</seg>
<seg id=263>the late palestinian leader arafat was a frequent guest at midnight mass after his return to the palestinian lands in 1994 , but arafat had been confined by israeli troops to his headquarters in ramallah since early december 2001 .</seg>
<seg id=264>the latin patriarch of jerusalem , sabbah , left jerusalem shortly after midday today and began his traditional march to manger square in bethlehem , where several thousand christian followers and muslim onlookers have being waiting for a long while .</seg>

<seg id=268>putin says acquiring main asset of yukos aimed at protecting national interests</seg>
<seg id=269>russian president putin said today that russia was protecting its national interests by acquiring the main asset of the russian oil giant yukos , in what was the first renationalization of the post-soviet era .</seg>
<seg id=270>at a year - end press conference in the kremlin , referring to the acquisition by the russian state petroleum company of yukos 's subsidiary yuganskneftegaz , putin said : " today russia is using absolutely legal market mechanisms to protect its national interests .</seg>
<seg id=271>i think that is completely normal . "</seg>
<seg id=272>the russian state petroleum company today became the new owner of yuganskneftegaz after buying the baikalfinansgroup that had won a secret auction for yuganskneftegaz .</seg>
<seg id=273>the russian state petroleum company announced surprisingly shortly before midnight yesterday that it had acquired 100 percent of the shares of the previously unknown baikalfinansgroup .</seg>
<seg id=274>the acquisition secures kremlin control of russia 's vital energy sector .</seg>
<seg id=275>russian authorities have been attacking the yukos company and its imprisoned billionaire founder khodorkovsky for almost 18 months .</seg>
<seg id=276>the russian state petroleum company is merging with the russian state gas company , and with the inclusion of yuganskneftegaz , the combined three will account for a fifth of russia 's oil output and all its natural gas production , making it the largest global energy group .</seg>
<seg id=277>putin justified the state 's current acquisition by criticizing the fraudulent 1990s privatizations .</seg>
<seg id=278>the privatization measures at that time handed the most precious assets of the russian economy to a handful of well - connected businessmen such as khodorkovsky .</seg>
<seg id=279>baikalfinansgroup earlier won control of yuganskneftegaz by offering 9.35 billion us dollars .</seg>

<seg id=292>japan 's ministry of internal affairs and communications tries telecommuting to reduce the stress of office life</seg>
<seg id=293>japan 's ministry of internal affairs and communications today launched an advanced internet program , through which it aims to have 20 percent of the japanese work force " telecommute " from home by 2010 , reducing the stress and family disruption brought about by office life .</seg>
<seg id=294>currently , around four million japanese , or six percent of japan 's 63.2 million working population , use technology to work away from their offices , said an official with the ministry of internal affairs and communications .</seg>
<seg id=295>starting from january , the ministry of internal affairs and communications will have six employees who do n't need to go to their offices at least one day a week ; instead they may work from home , universities or libraries through high - speed internet services .</seg>
<seg id=296>depending on their feedback , the ministry of internal affairs and communications will then expand this advanced program until 20 percent of its 2,500 employees are able to work from home by 2006 .</seg>
<seg id=297>the program , which enables employees to hold meetings through internet chat rooms and teleconferencing , is hoped to " improve the efficiency at work places , " said the official with the ministry of internal affairs and communications .</seg>
<seg id=298>he said telecommuting would allow workers to spend more time with their family , allowing bread earners to give more help with household duties .</seg>
<seg id=299>he added that the program would also help reduce traffic jams , car emissions , and overcrowding in trams during rush hours .</seg>
<seg id=300>he said the goal of this program is to raise the percentage of japanese telecommuters to 10 percent by 2005 and to 20 percent by 2010 " by encouraging the sharing of telecommuting expertise with private businesses . "</seg>

<seg id=323>it takes weeks to deliver relief supplies to aceh victims : un</seg>
<seg id=324>the united nations said today that it would take " weeks " before vital relief supplies could be delivered to tsunami victims in isolated areas of indonesia 's aceh province .</seg>
<seg id=325>us navy helicopters today flew into banda aceh , the capital of aceh province , as an increasing number of field hospitals were operating in the city and relief supplies poured into the airport .</seg>
<seg id=326>but director of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in indonesia , elmquist , told the correspondent that it was impossible to rapidly deliver the relief supplies due to various coordination and infrastructure problems .</seg>
<seg id=327>" it will take weeks before we send the relief supplies to all the isolated areas , " elmquist told the correspondent over the telephone after returning to capital jakarta from banda aceh .</seg>
<seg id=328>" it 's a worrying problem and we are leaving no stones unturned to establish a distribution system for banda aceh , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=329>the un and other relief organizations have warned residents in indonesia 's sumatra disaster area may die within days if they fail to immediately get clean water , staple food , and medical treatment .</seg>
<seg id=330>asked if the delayed delivery was nothing else than a death sentence for some tsunami victims , elmquist replied : " i hope not . i hope that people manage to get food and water , but obviously it 's not a situation we are pleased to see . "</seg>
<seg id=331>he said : " it 's a very serious situation and we can only hope there 's possibility to expedite the operations . "</seg>
<seg id=332>japan offers 500 million us dollars for disaster relief , the largest amount among of all countries</seg>
<seg id=333>japan today pledged 500 million us dollars in support of countries hit by the massive indian ocean tsunamis . as countries race to give a hand to victims of the world 's worst disaster , the donation from japan has ranked it no .1 among all countries and increased to 1.6 billion us dollars the total amount so far pledged internationally for relief and reconstruction .</seg>
<seg id=334>japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi said in a statement that japan , as asia 's largest economy , would consider more assistance , including money and expertise .</seg>
<seg id=335>he said : " japan will do its best to provide assistance in three aspects : financial resources , knowledge and expertise , and human resources . "</seg>
<seg id=336>" for the time being , japan will give affected countries and related international organizations 500 million dollars of cash donation as emergency assistance to handle the disaster , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=337>koizumi also said he would attend a meeting of world leaders on the 6th in the indonesian capital jakarta to discuss aid for the countries hit by tsunami .</seg>
<seg id=338>the united states yesterday increased its assistance ten - fold to 350 million us dollars after us president bush was criticized for being slow to respond to the massive human disaster .</seg>
<seg id=339>china , which is seen as increasingly having an intention to challenge japan 's influence in asia , also pledged 60.5 million us dollars , a large sum for a developing country .</seg>
<seg id=340>koizumi said : " japan will make more contributions by mobilizing helicopters and the personnel of the fire department . "</seg>
<seg id=341>" japan will also consider , as soon as possible , additional efforts , including utilizing japan self-defense forces aircraft , ships and personnel . "</seg>
<seg id=342>japan had previously promised 30 million us dollars in support of tsunami - hit countries .</seg>
<seg id=343>a foreign ministry spokesperson said the 30 million us dollars was included in the 500 million mentioned by koizumi .</seg>
<seg id=344>50 groups to provide medical assistance to indonesia 's aceh : who</seg>
<seg id=345>50 aid groups had arrived in indonesia 's aceh province to provide medical assistance to survivors of the tsunami , the world health organization said today .</seg>
<seg id=346>the who 's indonesian representative petersen said the who was trying to coordinate all the groups and held a meeting with them this afternoon .</seg>
<seg id=347>petersen said coordination was very difficult because many groups had gone directly into aceh for disaster relief .</seg>
<seg id=348>" we are trying to sort it out , each of the group has just come , but every group has expressed a great willingness to cooperate , " petersen said from jakarta in a telephone interview .</seg>
<seg id=349>petersen reiterated the who 's main concern was to prevent outbreaks of epidemics such as cholera and diarrhea , which could kill thousands of people .</seg>
<seg id=350>petersen said : " we are very worried because we have a lot of people homeless who do n't have sufficient clean water or adequate food .</seg>
<seg id=351>so everything is ready for epidemic outbreaks . "</seg>
<seg id=352>however petersen stressed there had been no signs of such problems from diseases so far .</seg>
<seg id=353>indonesia 's health ministry said the number of people killed in sumatra in the tsunami may hit 100,000 , with most of the victims in aceh province .</seg>
<seg id=354>as most medical facilities were destroyed in aceh province , the indonesian military and the governments of singapore and australia have set up at least eight field hospitals in the past week , and the united nations children 's fund has begun delivering basic medical kits to aid 200,000 children .</seg>
<seg id=355>powell predicts shiite victory in iraqi general election</seg>
<seg id=356>us secretary of state powell predicted today that shiites would win in the upcoming iraqi elections , but downplayed the concern for increased iranian influence in iraq in case of a shiite victory citing past discordance between iranian and iraqi shiites .</seg>
<seg id=357>there are growing indications that sunni muslims may either boycott the january 30 elections or be banned from the elections by relevant iraqi authorities for spreading insurgency .</seg>
<seg id=358>on american nbc 's " meet the press " show , powell said : " the new government coming into power , the transitional national assembly , will be majority shiite .</seg>
<seg id=359>the majority of the iraqi population is also shiite . "</seg>
<seg id=360>shiite muslims make up over 60 percent of the iraqi population , with most of them living in the southern and central parts of the country .</seg>
<seg id=361>sunnis live in central and western provinces , accounting for about 20 percent of the population .</seg>
<seg id=362>former iraqi foreign minister pachachi , who now heads the sunni - dominated iraqi independent democrats party , called today for postponing the elections , but powell said the iraqi elections would go on as scheduled .</seg>
<seg id=363>powell also said he felt it was impossible that shiite control of iraq 's future government would mean political situations in iraq would be dominated by iran .</seg>
<seg id=364>" i now believe that even though there may be iranian influence -- and iran will certainly try to influence political situations in iraq , there is significant difference and past serious disagreements and conflicts between iranian and iraqi shiites , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=365>as waves of international aid pour in , time increasingly unfavorable to tsunami victims</seg>
<seg id=366>foreign aid troops are dropping food and setting up clean water supply systems in areas hit by the asian tsunami to help millions of homeless and starving survivors .</seg>
<seg id=367>statistics show the death toll has climbed to just below 150,000 .</seg>
<seg id=368>relief supplies poured in from world governments , while us president bush entrusted his father senior bush and former president clinton with the task of raising private donations .</seg>
<seg id=369>a delegation headed by us secretary of state powell arrived in thailand late yesterday ahead of a crisis summit on the 6th in the indonesian capital jakarta to show us concern and assess the progress of relief efforts .</seg>
<seg id=370>powell 's entourage included president bush 's younger brother , florida governor jeb bush , and us agency for international development administrator natsios .</seg>
<seg id=371>powell was to head the delegation to inspect the devastation in thailand , indonesia , and sri lanka before attending the summit on the 6th .</seg>
<seg id=372>powell said that he had headed a delegation here to assess the devastation " and see what else the us might need to do , " but would n't immediately pledge any more aid besides the 350 million us dollars already promised .</seg>
<seg id=373>now days after the catastrophe , there has been talk of giving up the search for thousands of tourists still missing , many of them foreign tourists .</seg>
<seg id=374>however , thai prime minister thaksin vowed the search would go on in his country .</seg>
<seg id=375>" foreign experts have told me that they ( the missing ) may have been buried in mud in mangrove forests . we will continue to try our best to search and will not stop , " thaksin told reporters on phuket island .</seg>
<seg id=376>an unprecedented international relief effort is going on .</seg>
<seg id=377>navy helicopters dispatched from the us aircraft carrier lincoln are performing the tasks of dropping aid and picking up survivors for a second day in indonesia 's aceh province .</seg>
<seg id=378>rear admiral crowder , commander of carrier lincoln , said 50,000 sterling pounds of food and water had been delivered to disaster - hit areas and the mission was " going well . "</seg>
<seg id=379>political maneuvering hidden under righteous acts of aid for asian tsunami catastrophe</seg>
<seg id=380>as aid floods into areas hit by asia 's tsunami disaster , something less noble is also secretly underway : governments are wrangling over who should give , who should receive and who should dominate in the largest relief effort in modern times .</seg>
<seg id=381>the catastrophe that has killed nearly 150,000 people has rekindled old battle flames , including the discordance between the united states , united nations , and europe and the struggle to be the leader in asia .</seg>
<seg id=382>but relief experts still hold cautious hope . considering that the tsunami has hit so many countries , the global nature of the catastrophe might lead to another precedent : governments pledging aid will really make good on their promises .</seg>
<seg id=383>" there has never been a time where governments follow through their promises 100 percent and on time , " said juma , a professor of international development at harvard university 's kennedy school of government .</seg>
<seg id=384>with donations from governments already as high as two billion us dollars , major players in international politics including un secretary general annan and us secretary of state powell , as well as leaders of australia , china , and japan will hold a crisis summit rich with political overtones on the 6th in jakarta .</seg>
<seg id=385>us president bush has raised us assistance nearly ten - fold to 350 million us dollars after being accused of a slow response and un relief chief egeland openly lambasted rich nations for being " stingy . "</seg>
<seg id=386>in asia , the tsunami catastrophe fueled hidden wrestling for regional influence as an increasingly confident china promised 60.5 million us dollars in aid , a large sum for a developing nation .</seg>
<seg id=387>japan , which has been cutting down on its foreign aid budget for six consecutive years , acted quickly to smash any allegation that its national strength was declining by pledging to donate at least 500 million us dollars , a sum that dwarfed all other countries .</seg>
<seg id=388>world leaders descending on sri lanka to inspect devastation</seg>
<seg id=389>world leaders including un secretary general annan and us secretary of state powell were arriving in sri lanka to view in person devastation from the massive tsunami that claimed the lives of 30,600 people in sri lanka the end of last month , sri lankan officials said .</seg>
<seg id=390>they said powell had already arrived and south korean prime minister lee hae - chan would arrive shortly after noon .</seg>
<seg id=391>powell was to visit some of the areas worst hit by the tsunamis on december 26 last year , including galle region in the south where us marines were based for relief operations , the us embassy said in a press release .</seg>
<seg id=392>lee hae - chan would tour the west coastline accompanied by the sri lankan prime minister , the south korean embassy said .</seg>
<seg id=393>" accompanied by sri lankan prime minister rajapakse , the south korean prime minister will tour the western coast to view firsthand the resulting loss of lives , livelihoods and property , " the statement said .</seg>
<seg id=394>lee hae - chan would stop over in the worst - hit hambantota to oversee relief operations being carried out by the south korean private sector and non-governmental organizations .</seg>
<seg id=395>un secretary general annan is due to arrive in the evening to begin a two - day visit .</seg>
<seg id=396>" he will visit some of the affected regions in the south and the east , accompanied by world bank president wolfhensohn , " said un spokesman samarsinghe .</seg>
<seg id=397>world health organization director general lee jong - wook will also arrive in colombo today .</seg>
<seg id=398>german foreign minister fischer is due to arrive in sri lanka on the weekend .</seg>
<seg id=399>sri lankan officials say many other leaders are expected to come over the next few weeks .</seg>
<seg id=400>these leaders include canadian prime minister martin , whose trip to sri lanka and thailand later this month was announced in canada yesterday .</seg>
<seg id=401>us to boost peace efforts after palestinian elections : bush</seg>
<seg id=402>us president bush said today that he was " deeply heartened " by the strong turnout in today 's palestinian elections , and he also vowed that the us would boost its peace efforts .</seg>
<seg id=403>president bush said in a statement : " palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip took a key step towards building future democratic politics by electing a new president of the palestinian authority .</seg>
<seg id=404>observers of the general election have described it as free and fair . "</seg>
<seg id=405>" this is a historic day for the palestinian people and for the people of the middle east , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=406>exit polls showed former prime minister abbas had won the election by a huge margin with two - thirds of the votes .</seg>
<seg id=407>he would succeed arafat as president of the palestinian authority .</seg>
<seg id=408>" these efforts , including today 's presidential election and the parliamentary elections that will follow in several months , are essential for the establishment of a sovereign , independent , democratic , and peaceful palestinian state , and the new state will ensure a secure israel , " bush said .</seg>
<seg id=409>he said the us government looked forward to working with the newly - elected president of the palestinian authority and the palestinian people to advance the cause of middle east peace .</seg>
<seg id=410>peace in the middle east is consistent with the wishes of the israeli and palestinian peoples , which is to coexist peacefully and with safe .</seg>
<seg id=411>bush further urged israel to help improve the humanitarian and economic situation in the west bank and gaza strip .</seg>
<seg id=412>he added the arab states must " take concrete steps with all interested parties to create a regional environment conducive to peace , lend financial support to the palestinian people , and refuse to assist or harbor terrorists . "</seg>
<seg id=413>annan 's plan to visit rebel - held area in sri lanka was blocked</seg>
<seg id=414>un secretary general annan said today that he wanted to return to sri lanka one day to " see every part of the country . "</seg>
<seg id=415>annan has just ended a two - day visit in tsunami - hit areas of sri lanka , but reports said the sri lankan government blocked him from visiting northern areas held by the rebels .</seg>
<seg id=416>when asked in a press conference whether the sri lankan government had blocked him from traveling to zones held by the rebel liberation tigers of tamil eelam , as reported in several sri lankan newspapers , annan said : " i 'm hoping to come back and visit all parts of the country and help accelerate the peace process . "</seg>
<seg id=417>annan said president kumaratunga had personally objected to an on - site visit in guerrilla - held areas out of her fear that the rebels would use his visit as political bargaining chips .</seg>
<seg id=418>he said : " i raised the question of the peace process and the need to intensify the efforts for the peace process .</seg>
<seg id=419>i 've also discussed that with president kumaratunga . "</seg>
<seg id=420>annan 's inability to visit rebel - held areas has irritated residents of rebel - held city of jaffna in the north , where several hundred people protested in front of a un office in jaffna .</seg>
<seg id=421>however , the sri lankan government firmly denied the media reports , saying the media were " misreporting " the matter .</seg>
<seg id=422>on another front , as all parties dedicated themselves to the relief efforts , the sri lankan meteorological agency warned about possible typhoon strikes on sri lanka 's coastline , saying a typhoon was currently being formed offshore .</seg>
<seg id=423>russian space agency denies rocket fuel causes illness among children</seg>
<seg id=424>the british weekly science journal nature reported that highly toxic rocket fuel , spurted from russia 's space ship launches at the baikonur space base in kazakhstan , has caused serious diseases among children in the vicinity . russian space agency today denied such suggestion .</seg>
<seg id=425>the nature science journal published today quoted a study , saying that levels of endocrine and blood diseases among residents in polluted areas are twice as high as in normal regions .</seg>
<seg id=426>the study was conducted by epidemiologist zykov , who led a group of russian scientists .</seg>
<seg id=427>" it 's not confirmed that space - related activities have a direct influence on the health of residents , " the russian space agency responded .</seg>
<seg id=428>the study quoted by nature science magazine focused on children in the altai republic .</seg>
<seg id=429>the altai republic is located in a mountainous region on the fringes of siberia .</seg>
<seg id=430>the altai republic was chosen as the study subject because of pollution from unburnt fuel , especially hydrazine .</seg>
<seg id=431>some of russia 's space launching missions use hydrazine as the fuel during the early stages of take - off .</seg>
<seg id=432>zykov compared the health records of some 1,000 children in two polluted areas for the years 1998-2000 with 3,300 health records of a nearby unpolluted control group .</seg>
<seg id=433>he concluded that the percentage of children needing medical care in the worst - polluted areas was twice as high as that of the unpolluted control group , and that the duration of treatment was also twice as long , the nature science journal reported .</seg>
<seg id=434>white house says iraqi elections will certainly have flaws</seg>
<seg id=435>the white house acknowledged today that iraqi elections slated for january 30 are " not going to be perfect " ; meanwhile two more car bombs exploded today in iraq 's mosul , killing at least two iraqi soldiers .</seg>
<seg id=436>asked if he agreed with iraqi prime minister allawi 's words that violence would make voting impossible in some areas of iraq , white house spokesman mcclellan said : " we all acknowledge that the election is not going to be perfect . "</seg>
<seg id=437>" this is the first time iraqis will be able to freely choose their leaders . it 's the election for a transitional government , and it 's one of three elections this year , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=438>" so we 're going to do everything possible to help the iraqi people and the interim government ensure as many people as possible participate in this upcoming election , " mcclellan said .</seg>
<seg id=439>allawi acknowledged that some parts of iraq would not be able to take part in this month 's election , as bloody insurgency on the 11th killed at least 25 people , six of whom died in a car bombing in former president hussein 's hometown of tikrit .</seg>
<seg id=440>meanwhile , two more car bombs exploded in iraq 's mosul today , leaving at least two iraqi soldiers dead .</seg>

<seg id=443>us trade deficit in november tops 60 billion us dollars , setting fresh records</seg>
<seg id=444>according to data released by the us commerce department today , us exports shrank 2.3 percent in november last year , sending the trade deficit to an all - time high of 60.3 billion us dollars .</seg>
<seg id=445>while exports fell to a five - month low of 95.6 billion us dollars , imports rose 1.3 percent to a record 155.8 billion as orders for imported oil increased by 1.3 percent , or more than 2 billion dollars , to a record 14.2 billion .</seg>
<seg id=446>the trade gap increased 7.7 percent from october 's revised 56 billion dollars and soared sharply by 50.8 percent from 40 billion for november of the previous year .</seg>
<seg id=447>wall street economists had expected the trade deficit for goods and services to shrink to about 53.3 billion us dollars , according to a survey conducted by cbs marketwatch .</seg>
<seg id=448>although the weakening dollar has made us - made products cheaper both at home and abroad , the us trade deficit continues to widen .</seg>
<seg id=449>today 's report from the commerce department will put more pressure on the greenback and renew calls for washington to act on energy independence and the trade imbalance with china .</seg>
<seg id=450>the decline in us exports for november last year was the result of a 1.4 - billion - dollar slump in capital goods , including a drop of 325 million us dollars in aircraft and aircraft engines .</seg>
<seg id=451>exports of industrial materials , most are energy related , fell by 800 million us dollars .</seg>

<seg id=453>japan 's defense agency chief : remember militarist past , respect dignity of neighboring countries</seg>
<seg id=454>japan 's defense agency chief yoshinori ono said today that japan would not forget its militarist past and would keep in mind the " dignity " of asian neighbors as it took a higher profile internationally .</seg>
<seg id=455>" while we get along with southeast asian nations , we should never forget the past , " ono said when asked about possible unease over japan 's dispatch of troops to tsunami - hit areas in south asia .</seg>
<seg id=456>he told reporters : " we must build a relationship with friendly nations , which allows us to tell them we have good intentions .</seg>
<seg id=457>we should pay full respect to the dignity of other countries while we are looking at the past . "</seg>
<seg id=458>ono particularly noted that this year marked the 60th anniversary of the end of second world war and said : " we want to be reborn and cooperate for the sake of a new era . "</seg>
<seg id=459>ono , who has just wound up his visit to several tsunamis - hit counties in south asia , said he felt the " dignity " of an independent country when indonesian leaders told him that japanese troops should finish their relief mission by the end of march at the latest .</seg>
<seg id=460>the united nations has voiced concern over the deadline the indonesian government has imposed on foreign troops .</seg>
<seg id=461>foreign troops are widely praised for reaching some of the remotest tsunami survivors .</seg>
<seg id=462>nearly 1,000 members of japan 's self-defense forces are heading to countries ravaged by the december 26 tsunamis that have so far killed more than 163,000 people .</seg>
<seg id=463>this is the biggest deployment of japan 's self-defense forces since the end of the second world war .</seg>
<seg id=464>japan 's us - dominated postwar constitution stipulated that the self-defense forces must not use force .</seg>
<seg id=465>political intervention in nhk program ? debate erupts in japanese media</seg>
<seg id=466>allegations that pressures from politicians forced the public - run japan broadcasting corporation ( nhk ) to shorten a program aired a few years ago on japan 's slavery of comfort women during world war ii have left liberal japanese media at odds with their conservative counterparts .</seg>
<seg id=467>liberal japanese media have assailed nhk for slashing large portions of interviews it had conducted , mostly with critics of japan 's wartime conduct and victims of enslaved comfort women , allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders .</seg>
<seg id=468>but conservative newspapers have justified nhk 's decision to edit the show , believing the company 's senior management has a duty to ensure its programs are fair and objective .</seg>
<seg id=469>the controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on the crime of the japanese military of enslaving comfort women during wartime .</seg>
<seg id=470>the trial , held by a women 's rights group in tokyo in december 2000 , found the late emperor hirohito guilty of allowing the slavery of comfort women by japanese military during japan 's occupation of asian nations .</seg>
<seg id=471>historians say at least 200,000 young women , mostly from korea but also from taiwan , china , the philippines , and indonesia , were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline japanese military brothels during wartime .</seg>
<seg id=472>the program 's producer satoru nagai held a tearful press conference on the 13th , disclosing that before the program was aired , senior nhk officials met with lawmakers of the ruling liberal democratic party , shinzo abe and shoichi nakagawa , both of whom had expressed concerns over the content of the program .</seg>
<seg id=473>nagai said top nhk officials then edited and shortened the program .</seg>
<seg id=474>" nhk bowed to political pressure , " he said .</seg>
<seg id=475>abe and nakagawa admitted meeting with nhk officials and telling them to be " fair " but firmly denied pressuring the company .</seg>
<seg id=476>eurozone data show core inflation under control</seg>
<seg id=477>economists said today that eurozone economic data to be released this week would show core inflation remained under control .</seg>
<seg id=478>meanwhile , eurozone industrial output and french consumer spending are both expected to fall .</seg>
<seg id=479>the european union 's statistics office eurostat is expected to confirm that inflation edged up to 2.3 percent in december from 2.2 percent in november when it releases inflation data on the 20th of this month .</seg>
<seg id=480>but the increase largely reflects the rise in tobacco tax , and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9 percent .</seg>
<seg id=481>core inflation figures are to be released with consumer prices figures .</seg>
<seg id=482>economists noted core inflation , which excludes food , energy , tobacco and alcohol prices , has remained in a 1.6 to 2.0 percent range for the past two years .</seg>
<seg id=483>european central bank president trichet said on the 13th that short - term price pressures have dwindled recently .</seg>
<seg id=484>while inflation will remain above two percent in the coming months , it is likely to drop by the end of this year .</seg>
<seg id=485>meanwhile , another economist said the eurozone november industrial output due on the 18th is expected to fall , given growth slowdown in germany .</seg>
<seg id=486>german industrial output declined 1.7 percent in november , and a survey among economists conducted by afp financial news services shows eurozone output would slip another 0.4 percent in november after a 0.5 percent fall in october .</seg>
<seg id=487>eurozone industrial output is expected to rebound in december , said schmieding of bank of america .</seg>
<seg id=488>bureaucracy adds to the woes of tsunami survivors</seg>
<seg id=489>three weeks after the worst tsunami in history , survivors are struggling with vices such as bureaucracy and politicking , while the world 's attention has turned elsewhere .</seg>
<seg id=490>thousands of rotten corpses dug out of the debris drove the death toll from the december 26 tsunami catastrophe to more than 168,000 , while the upcoming iraqi elections and president bush 's inauguration gala have replaced the tsunami as the headlines in global media .</seg>
<seg id=491>indonesia had initially asked foreign troops involved in humanitarian missions to leave the country within three months , but later took back the demand .</seg>
<seg id=492>in thailand , leaders of canada , sweden , norway and finland were gathering for a discussion over a reconstruction plan and efforts to identify the dead .</seg>
<seg id=493>but survivors are faced with new difficulties , such as inveterate bureaucracy in indonesia , which hinders the distribution of aid pouring in from across the world .</seg>
<seg id=494>" we are like persons who do not exist . we have suffered great losses in the tsunami , losing everything and are starving , " said busriadi , a fisherman in a small village near the capital of aceh province , banda aceh , on indonesia 's sumatra island .</seg>
<seg id=495>he said : " where are the food , the clothes and other relief supplies we see on television flooding into aceh ?</seg>
<seg id=496>busriadi , like thousands of disaster - battered survivors , lost his identity cards and other official documents due to the tsunami , which makes his efforts to gain aid a nightmare .</seg>
<seg id=497>although he begs government officials for help and shuttle everyday from one place to another to go through all sorts of formalities , the results are always the same : he is not able to get relief supplies .</seg>
<seg id=498>zeng qinghong reportedly visited zhao ziyang before his death</seg>
<seg id=499>chinese vice president zeng qinghong visited zhao ziyang , the deposed former general secretary of the chinese communist party , in the hospital just before he died this morning , the hong kong - based china information center for human rights and democracy said .</seg>
<seg id=500>the information center said that according to zhao ziyang 's family , zeng qinghong visited zhao ziyang at the beijing hospital at 6:00 am this morning , about an hour before he died at the age of 85 .</seg>
<seg id=501>zhao ziyang once served as the general secretary of the ccp and premier . he was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the use of force to suppress the democratic movement in tiananmen square . he had been under house arrest and deemed persona non grata by the government ever since .</seg>
<seg id=502>the information center said that according to zao 's family , the sitting premier wen jiabao , who once worked as zhao ziyang 's subordinate , did not visit him when he was critically ill .</seg>
<seg id=503>but retired central committee member and his one - time aide tian jiyun visited him before zhao ziyang slipped into a coma on the 14th .</seg>
<seg id=504>the information center for human rights and democracy has maintained contact with zao 's family and has for years issued timely and correct information on zhao ziyang 's situation .</seg>
<seg id=505>the information center said some 20 retired top party , government and military leaders were preparing an open letter to the ccp , calling for a reappraisal of zhao ziyang 's contributions and demanding a public funeral for him .</seg>
<seg id=506>the center also said that zhao ziyang 's family would not be allowed to hold or organize the funeral and the party would make the final decision on arrangements .</seg>
<seg id=507>zhao ziyang 's wife , liang boqi , is 86 years old .</seg>
<seg id=508>the center added she had not been told of her husband 's death as of this early evening due to her poor health .</seg>
<seg id=509>zhao ziyang passed away , china urged to promote democratization</seg>
<seg id=510>zhao ziyang , a former leader of the chinese communist party , was highly commended worldwide after he died of illness today . japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , the taiwanese government , and overseas chinese democracy activists all coincided in appeals to beijing to carry out zhao ziyang 's vision of democratic reforms .</seg>
<seg id=511>zhao was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the military suppression of the democratic movement at tiananmen square . he was put under house arrest for the rest of his life and died this morning at a beijing hospital at the age of 85 .</seg>
<seg id=512>" i hope they ( china ) are committed to democratization , " japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi said while mourning for zhao ziyang , according to reports by jiji press .</seg>
<seg id=513>taiwan also urged china to carry out democratic and political reforms after zhao 's death .</seg>
<seg id=514>overseas chinese democracy activists regarded zhao ziyang as " one of china 's greatest reformers , " who sacrificed his political life to oppose the bloody suppression of the democratic movement at tiananmen square .</seg>
<seg id=515>lian shengde , president of new york - based free china movement and once a student movement leader , said : " during his 15 - year house arrest , he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress towards the rule of law and democracy .</seg>
<seg id=516>zhao ziyang will be remembered by later generations as a true democrat and a person of principle . "</seg>
<seg id=517>democratic activists have requested china hold a public funeral for zhao ziyang and give fair appraisal for his achievements .</seg>
<seg id=518>but they acknowledged zhao ziyang was unlikely to receive such courtesy because the chinese government feared that the masses , dissatisfied with the rule of the communist party , would take this opportunity to start an insurgency .</seg>
<seg id=519>the 1989 student movement was prompted by the death of pro-reform leader hu yangbao .</seg>
<seg id=520>xinhua news agency released a brief report today , saying that comrade zhao ziyang died in beijing due to illness , which is the only official comment on the matter .</seg>

<seg id=553>shanghai becomes world 's no .1 power generating equipment producer in output and capacity</seg>
<seg id=554>shanghai , december 1 , xinhua ( reporter jiang wei ) with the completion of the trial - run of a 660 - megawatt generator unit , shanghai turbine generator co ,. ltd , a subsidiary of the shanghai electric power generation group , reached the annual production target of 15,000 - megawatt units on the 1st , ahead of schedule . this makes shanghai the world 's no .1 producer of power plant equipment in both output and capacity , realizing the long - time dream of several generations of workers in china 's equipment manufacturing industry .</seg>
<seg id=555>the shanghai electric power generation group is the largest power plant equipment manufacturing base in china .</seg>
<seg id=556>in recent years , with the rapid growth of demand for power generating equipment in china , generator manufacturers across the country have entered a period of high growth and great development .</seg>
<seg id=557>the shanghai electric power generation group has integrated its advantageous resources in power generating equipment such as steam turbines and power plant boilers . after taking orders of four units of million - kilowatt thermal generators , it received production orders for nine heavy gas generator units and three waste - heat boilers by way of a lump sum tender .</seg>
<seg id=558>at the same time , through integrated operations , it further improved the efficiency of enterprise management , technical development and production .</seg>
<seg id=559>at present , the shanghai electric power generation group represents 40 percent of china 's power plant equipment industry and is continuously expanding its overseas market in the middle east , southeast asia and south america .</seg>
<seg id=560>this year alone , as a producer of components for the mainframes of power generating equipment , the shanghai turbine company received sales orders valued at 6 billion yuan .</seg>
<seg id=561>the " electricity shortage " this summer has significantly driven up the demand for power plant equipment across the nation , and competition in the power plant equipment manufacturing market is increasingly hot , said zheng jianhua , president of the shanghai electric power generation group .</seg>
<seg id=562>the group is implementing the three grand targets of " researching and developing million - kilowatt thermal , gas turbine generator units and million - kilowatt nuclear power " so as to realize the goal of being listed in the global 500 at an early date .</seg>
<seg id=563>( hong kong , macau , taiwan ) hong kong observatory provides new services to world meteorological organization websites</seg>
<seg id=564>hong kong , december 2 ( xinhua ) hong kong 's observatory launches two new services , starting today , for the " world weather information service " and the " severe weather information center " websites maintained by the world meteorological organization .</seg>
<seg id=565>a spokesman at the observatory said the two new services were : adding global official weather observation on cloudiness and rain to the " world weather information service " website , and adding a recap function of the tropical cyclone tracks for the past seven days to the " severe weather information center " website .</seg>
<seg id=566>these two new services come right after hong kong 's observatory began to provide official observation data on global heavy rain ( including snow ) for the " severe weather information center " early this year .</seg>
<seg id=567>it was mentioned that the " world weather information service " website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatic data for major world cities .</seg>
<seg id=568>the new service provides , for the first time , global official weather observation , with the global distribution graphs of cloudiness and rain as its first service .</seg>
<seg id=569>the new web page features a wide coverage and high density and is updated regularly , up to eight times a day .</seg>
<seg id=570>the new product on the " severe weather information center " website is a recap function for tropical cyclone tracking .</seg>
<seg id=571>in the previous design , the website would no longer store information , such as the location , of a tropical cyclone once it had dissipated .</seg>
<seg id=572>however , there are people who would like to obtain relevant information about a tropical cyclone several days after it has landed .</seg>
<seg id=573>therefore , the new product stores information on the intensity , location and track of tropical cyclones for the past seven days , allowing the public and the media to retrieve needed information after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated .</seg>
<seg id=574>world 's first rapid diagnostic kit for h5n1 bird flu virus successfully developed in shantou</seg>
<seg id=575>shantou , december 3 , xinhua ( zhang yiwen and lin junqiang ) the reporters learned from the shantou university 's medical college / university of hong kong 's medical faculty joint influenza research center that they have developed the world 's first rapid diagnostic kit for h5n1 bird flu virus , after half a year of cooperation with xiamen 's university .</seg>
<seg id=576>using this rapid assay to test specimens from suspected cases , the diagnosis of bird flu infection can be made in as short as less than an hour .</seg>
<seg id=577>based on existing information , bird flu , which is listed as a highly toxic killer virus , has a mortality rate far higher than that of the sars virus , said professor guan yi , director of the shantou university 's medical college / university of hong kong 's medical faculty joint influenza research center .</seg>
<seg id=578>previously it would take between 3 to 5 days , and sometimes more than a week to confirm " suspected " viruses .</seg>
<seg id=579>the successfully introduced rapid test for bird flu viruses uses the enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and the gold - labeling assay to test specimens such as excreta , nasal pharyngeal secretions , chick embryo - cultured intact virus or split virus , as well as serum . the diagnosis of bird flu virus infection may be reached in one to two hours .</seg>
<seg id=580>the new techniques are easy , convenient and rapid , and allow for detection in the outbreak site . with an accuracy of more than 90 percent , they help with early detection , early diagnosis , early isolation and early treatment of the infectious virus , avoiding wide epidemic and severe plague .</seg>
<seg id=581>commissioned by the chinese center for disease control and prevention , shantou university 's medical college / university of hong kong 's medical faculty joint influenza research center recently hosted a training workshop on bird flu virus assay techniques for trainees from 20 provincial and municipal centers for disease prevention and control across the country , on which the latest rapid assay techniques for bird flu virus were demonstrated .</seg>
<seg id=582>spokesman for foreign ministry commissioner 's office in hk expresses strong dissatisfaction with speech of us house international relations committee chairman hyde</seg>
<seg id=583>hong kong , december 3 ( xinhua ) a spokesman for the office of the commissioner of the ministry of foreign affairs in hong kong issued a statement on the 3rd , expressing strong dissatisfaction with a speech delivered a few days ago in hong kong by us house international relations committee chairman , rep . hyde .</seg>
<seg id=584>the spokesman said that the speech delivered on the 2nd in hong kong by mr. hyde , chairman of the us house international relations committee , viciously attacked china 's development and progress , and smeared china 's foreign policy with cold - war mentality ; " we are strongly dissatisfied with it " .</seg>
<seg id=585>the spokesman said it is widely known that china 's development is not only in the fundamental interest of 1.3 billion chinese people , but also contributes to the world 's prosperity and development .</seg>
<seg id=586>china is a responsible country in the international political arena and has played a positive and constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability .</seg>
<seg id=587>regarding nuclear non-proliferation , china has all along strictly complied with relevant international conventions , firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in all forms , and advocated settlement of such issues through negotiations , talks and by strengthening international monitoring .</seg>
<seg id=588>the spokesman noted that mr. hyde , unfortunately , ignored these facts and made those extremely irresponsible comments at a moment when the sino - us relations are heading towards soundness and stability . this is completely against the common understanding reached recently between the chinese and us leaders on bilateral ties , it contradics the mainstream voices in american society advocating the strengthening of cooperative relations with china , and will undoubtedly do harm to the development of sino - us relations .</seg>
<seg id=589>china 's biggest sea water desalinization project settles in zhoushan</seg>
<seg id=590>hangzhou , december 6 , xinhua ( pan yifeng and xu qun ) the biggest ever sea water desalinization project in mainland china , with a daily treatment volume of up to 10,000 tons , will settle in the putuo district of zhoushan city , in the province of zhejiang .</seg>
<seg id=591>for residents of zhoushan , who have long suffered from water shortages , the vast sea water besides them will soon become clear and sweet tap water streaming into thousands of households .</seg>
<seg id=592>the reporters learned from relevant authorities that the state oceanic administration 's hangzhou water treatment technology development center and the government of liuheng town in zhoushan 's putuo district signed a cooperation agreement a few days ago on a ten - thousand - ton sea water desalinization project .</seg>
<seg id=593>with a 50 million yuan investment and a daily fresh water output of 10,000 tons , the project so far is the biggest sea water desalinization project in mainland china . the first phase of the project is expected to be completed next year .</seg>
<seg id=594>zhoushan city is one of the water - starved cities in china .</seg>
<seg id=595>there are a total of 1,390 islands , large and small , across the city , with an average fresh water availability of 601 cubic meters per person , which is only 25.4 percent of the average level for zhejiang province . the water supply problem has long disrupted the lives of residents in the island city .</seg>
<seg id=596>liuheng town in the putuo district , for example , has to transport 1,500 tons of fresh water from a nearby town every day , and the cost per ton is over 10 yuan .</seg>
<seg id=597>the reverse osmosis sea water desalinization technology developed by the state oceanic administration 's hangzhou water treatment technology development center is a pressure - driven film separation process , a hot topic in current international sea water desalinization research .</seg>
<seg id=598>responsible personnel from the center said that through technological improvement and equipment localization , the cost and power consumption of the reverse osmosis sea water desalinization project have both been slashed .</seg>
<seg id=599>the cost of desalinizing one ton of sea water will drop further to the level of 5 yuan .</seg>
<seg id=600>this forebodes that the cost of sea water desalinization is likely to be close to the prices of tap water and industrial water .</seg>

<seg id=627>presidents or delegates attending the meeting will hold discussions on plans to deepen integration of the andean region and on the promotion of economic and social development .</seg>
<seg id=628>in a message delivered at the opening ceremony of the meeting , peru 's president toledo said it had been 35 years since the establishment of ancom , but major problems such as poverty were still unresolved .</seg>
<seg id=629>at present the poverty rate in the andean region is as high as 53 percent , posing a serious threat to the region 's democratic governance .</seg>
<seg id=630>therefore , ancom member governments should seek to establish effective mechanisms to get rid of poverty and to promote public participation in national affairs , so as to improve social stability and development .</seg>
<seg id=631>toledo said that although quite a few issues were yet to be addressed within the ancom , great progress had been made towards south american integration , and the establishment of a south american community of nations would be announced at the third south american summit to be held here on the 8th .</seg>
<seg id=632>he expressed his belief that the creation of the new regional bloc would play a vital role in promoting the region 's political , economic and social development .</seg>

<seg id=638>construction of underground power plant to begin soon for three gorges project</seg>
<seg id=639>wuhan , december 8 , xinhua ( reporter shi yongfeng ) bids were publicly invited for the first time on december 8 for the main part of an underground power plant for the three gorges project , a prelude to the construction of the three gorges underground power plant .</seg>
<seg id=640>the three gorges project is designed to install twenty - six 700,000 - kilowatt hydraulic generator units , with an installed capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts . once the generator units are all in production , the average power generation per year will be 84.7 billion kilowatt hours .</seg>
<seg id=641>with the aim to further explore the power generating potential of the three gorges project , the three gorges project has reserved spaces in its initial design for building an underground powerhouse as an extension project .</seg>
<seg id=642>according to officials at the china three gorges project corporation , the three gorges underground power plant is laid out in the mountains on the right bank of the three gorges dam , with major buildings such as the intake tower , diversion tunnel , main plant , tailrace system , busbar shaft and 500kv transformer substation .</seg>
<seg id=643>the underground power plant will have six 700,000 - kilowatt generator units .</seg>
<seg id=644>this will increase the number of generator units installed in the three gorges project to 32 from 26 designed originally and the installed capacity will soar to 22.4 million kilowatts from 18.2 million kilowatts , which will significantly strengthen the power generation capability of the three gorges project .</seg>
<seg id=645>flood prevention is the top priority for building the three gorges project .</seg>
<seg id=646>based on the operation schedule of the three gorges reservoir , the water level in the three gorges reservoir will be lowered from the normal pond level of 175m to the flood control level of 145m each year before the flood season .</seg>
<seg id=647>therefore , the construction of the underground power plant will increase the water usage rate of the three gorges reservoir , reduce water loss and increase power generation , thus maximizing the time of peak regulation without water loss .</seg>
<seg id=648>currently , the earlier phase projects of the three gorges underground power plant , such as adit excavation , tailrace canal excavation and timbering , have begun in advance .</seg>
<seg id=649>it is said that the underground power plant will be fully completed and put into production by the end of 2008 .</seg>

<seg id=709>said chen tianqiao , chairman of shanghai 's shanda networking development co., ltd.</seg>
<seg id=710>while the media is creating good conditions for minors to grow up soundly , the need for market competition and economic interests , plus the low quality of some media staff , has made opinions in some articles misleading for the thinking and values of teenagers , and some media even spread violent and pornographic content .</seg>

<seg id=717>zebari said the us - led coalition is in iraq to protect the country at the request of iraq , since the current interim iraqi government cannot control the security situation and lacks the ability to wipe out terrorists and saboteurs .</seg>
<seg id=718>the existence of the coalition has a time limit . according to un resolutions , this will end after iraq has completed its political process and a legitimate government has emerged .</seg>
<seg id=719>zebari stressed that new iraq will maintain its arab and islamic nature and comply with the charter of the league of arab states .</seg>
<seg id=720>the iraqi people face the historic opportunity of rebuilding the nation on a new basis . iraq will rise again and become an important member that makes contributions to its own ethnic group within the arab family .</seg>

<seg id=760>a domain name system is like the " nerve system " that controls information transfer on the internet .</seg>
<seg id=761>china has more than 90 million internet users as of now , which is the second largest number worldwide , and the number of websites has topped 650,000 , said mao wei , director of china 's internet network information center , the administrator of china 's country code top - level domain name system .</seg>
<seg id=762>the volume of domain name resolution is proportional to internet users , and with the fast development of the internet , the volume of domain name resolution also increases rapidly .</seg>
<seg id=763>at present , registration of cn domains grows by 10,000 every month , with a total number of 430,000 .</seg>
<seg id=764>the country code top - level domain name server run and managed by china 's internet network information center processes over 380 million domain name resolution requests every day , with an average of over 4,400 requests processed in one second and a peak value of 8,000 .</seg>

<seg id=772>this is what the reporters learned on the 22nd from china 's ganzhou tungsten industry development strategy workshop currently being held .</seg>
<seg id=773>known as the " industrial tooth , " hard alloy is used in cutting tools , high pressure tools , and mechanics of mining and paving engineering for its high rigidity and abrasion resistance . development of the hard alloy industry is vital to the overall development of the tungsten industry .</seg>
<seg id=774>it was mentioned that china 's hard alloy industry started from scratch in the 1950s , and after continuously development , it now has made remarkable achievements .</seg>
<seg id=775>in the early 1980s , when the world 's annual hard alloy output was 25,000 tons , china produced 5,000 tons of hard alloy a year ; stepping into the 21st century , the world 's annual hard alloy output is 38,000 , while china 's hard alloy production per year has soared rapidly to 15,000 tons , or more than one - third of the hard alloy output in the world .</seg>
<seg id=776>china has also made significant progress in hard alloy export .</seg>
<seg id=777>china 's annual hard alloy export was just 100 tons in 1986 , and the export volume had reached 2,500 tons by 2003 . the export volume is expected to reach more than 3,000 tons this year , which , like the output , also accounts for one - third of the circulation in worldwide hard alloy markets . the foreign currency earned annually through hard alloy export increased from below four million us dollars a year in the past to 70 million us dollars a year nowadays .</seg>

<seg id=788>methane is a highly explosive gas and needs to be drained first in coal mining operations to ensure a safe working environment .</seg>
<seg id=789>removal , capture and use of methane will reduce greenhouse gas emissions , contributing to the alleviation of global warming and climate change .</seg>
<seg id=790>the greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide .</seg>
<seg id=791>substituting methane for coal increases fuel cleanliness , improves coal mine efficiency , and results in cleaner air .</seg>
<seg id=792>hassing , an adb senior project specialist , said the project was expected to yield a reduction of about 4.5 million tons in carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emission .</seg>

<seg id=814>an inquiry conducted by the shenzhen water bureau shows shenzhen once had more than 70 buildings equipped with a " reclaimed water " recycling system in the middle 1990s , but the builders had to give up the utilization as the cost of " reclaimed water " recycling was too high due to factors such as technology , design and management .</seg>
<seg id=815>to have these pipelines play a real role , what needs to be done is to simply invest an additional 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in installing a " reclaimed water " treatment system .</seg>
<seg id=816>if utilized , the over 70 existing " reclaimed water " pipelines can save 35,000 tons of tap water for shenzhen in one single day , based on each neighborhood using 500 tons of " reclaimed water " per day .</seg>
<seg id=817>it was said that shenzhen will start its " reclaimed water " recycling by renovating the over 70 buildings that have existing " reclaimed water " systems , and will further expand the project after summing up experience .</seg>
<seg id=818>in the meantime , the shenzhen municipal water department will work with the urban planning and construction departments to formulate as soon as possible codes for the design of reclaimed water , and prescribe the enforcement of " reclaimed water " use in larger buildings .</seg>
<seg id=819>the treated " reclaimed water " will be first used in urban green area irrigation .</seg>
